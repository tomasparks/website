I been wanting to get back into do digital art again :)   
But I don't have the Patience for programs that max out my CPU for too long[^1]:

* to render images
* to process the polygon meshs

so I have started to looking into Amazon EC2 services


[^1]: I may have the cpu time on my desktop computer, but I rearly turn it on unless I need to use some windows software.
