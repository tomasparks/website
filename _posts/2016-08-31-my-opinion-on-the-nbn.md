I have a problem with the NBN network it is out-of-date!!!    
It Should be Called "Nation Broadcast Network" NOT the "Nation Broadband Network" because the Network is following the "Broadcast" model of thinking.

 * The fibre to the X works like an Express train network.
 * Wireless works like the Radio/TV broadcast.

the next generation of Internet will be ....

* peer2peer based
* Decentralized

.... Witch the NBN is incappale of supporting.


### other the other hand ###

I agree with:

 * fibre to the premises (FTTP)
