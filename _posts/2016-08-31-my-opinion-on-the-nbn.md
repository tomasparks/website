I the problem, I have I can see is that the NBN network is out-of-date!!!
It Should be Called "Nation Broadcast Network" NOT the "Nation Broadband Network" because the Network is following the "Broadcast" model of thinking.
 * The fibre to the X works like an Express train network.
 * Wireless works like the Radio/TV broadcast.

the next generation Internet will be ....

* peer2peer based
* Decentralized

.... Witch the NBN is incappale of supporting.


### other the other hand ###

I agree with:

 * fibre to the premises (FTTP)
