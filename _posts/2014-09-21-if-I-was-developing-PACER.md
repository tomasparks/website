[PACER][PACER] (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) was in the news again today for being outdated and charging too much for public domain documents


In 1988: Gen 1
---------------------


I would have used a modified version of [fidonet][fidonet] to distribute the files between the offices
the court document would be saved in [TIFF][TIFF] and ascii plain text (OCRed from the Tiff files)
I may have had [leased line][leased line] between the offices

[TIFF]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_Image_File_Format
[leased line]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leased_line

In 1992: Gen 2
---------------------

I would have started running a [Gopher][Gopher] server

In 1996: Gen 3
---------------------

I would have started runing a website using [Apache][AHTTP]

In 2002: Gen 4
---------------------

I would have started using [openvpn][oVPN] and stopped using the leased lines
