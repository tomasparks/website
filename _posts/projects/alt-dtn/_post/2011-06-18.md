[dtn-interest] Visual Sensor Network

Tom Sparks <tom_a_sparks@yahoo.com.au> Sat, 18 June 2011 09:19 UTC

I am looking at setting up a Visual Sensor Network to take photographs of lighhtning and other weather (towns name sake)

the node must use energy harvesting methods only
I am not looking at live video feeds

I think I have found the brains for the node (pandaboard or Beagleboard), but they has too much extra junk or are missing key features

I am looking for other options
needs: 
* usb port for webcam
* Wifi
* port for hard drive

we have 4 tours bus routes I can use as data mules, but I don't want to use them until there are have enough nodes on the bus's routes

I am wondering if there are any papers I can use to base this project on?

the closest paper to this project is Panoptes: Scalable Low-Power Video Sensor Networking Technologies

The following papers came to mind :

1.* SensEye: a multi-tier camera sensor network*
http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1101191

2. Irisnet: An architecture for a worldwide sensor
web<http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/MPRV.2003.1251166>
http://www.pittsburgh.intel-research.net/people/gibbons/papers/NDGS02.pdf

3. A Survey of Visual Sensor Networks
http://www.hindawi.com/journals/am/2009/640386/

I havent looked at sensor networks in years, so may not be the most current

Best,
ashish

the SensEye setup is to complex

nice idea for on-the-gird/network sensor nodes

i've been meaning to read this one

the more papers I read the more I keep going back to Panoptes paper[1]

but without "reinventing the wheel", I am looking at using motion[2] for camera control and DTN2 with prophet
