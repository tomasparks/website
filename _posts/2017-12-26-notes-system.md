I am curently writing a custom indieweb [note](https://indieweb.org/note) system for my webiste, my requirements are different to most/all indieweb implementation as I need three different way of creating notes Online, Browser and Offline

### Online / text-editor ###


### web Browser / mircopub ###

Unimplementated

### Offline / CSV ###

I use a PDA[^1:], when I away from my computers, the PDA has good database software witch can export [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files
