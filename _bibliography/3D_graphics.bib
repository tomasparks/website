  abstract = {A platform-independent occlusion culling library for dynamic environments, dPVS, can benefit such applications as CAD and modeling tools, time-varying simulations, and computer games. Visibility optimization is currently the most effective technique for improving rendering performance in complex 3D environments. The primary reason for this is that during each frame the pixel processing subsystem needs to determine the visibility of each pixel individually. Currently, rendering performance in larger scenes is input sensitive, and most of the processing time is wasted on rendering geometry not visible in the final image. Here we concentrate on real-time visualization using mainstream graphics hardware that has a z-buffer as a de facto standard for hidden surface removal. In an ideal system only the complexity of the geometry actually visible on the screen would significantly impact rendering time - 3D application performance should be output sensitive.},

  abstract  = {We present a method to populate very large terrains with very detailed features such as roads, rivers, lakes and fields. These features can be interactively edited, and the landscape can be explored in real time at any altitude from flight view to car view. We use vector descriptions of linear and areal features, with associated shaders to specify their appearance (terrain color and material), their footprint (effect on terrain shape), and their associated objects (bridges, hedges, etc.).In order to encompass both very large terrains and very fine details we rely on a view dependent quadtree refinement scheme. New quads are generated when needed and cached on the GPU. For each quad we produce on the GPU an appearance texture, a footprint texture, and some object meshes, based on the features vector description and their associated shaders. Adaptive refinement, procedural vector features and a mipmap pyramid provide three LOD mechanisms for small, medium and large scale quads. Our results and attached video show high performance with high visual quality.},

  abstract = {Within this paper, we present a novel, straightforward progressive encoding scheme for general triangle soups, which is particularly well-suited for mobile and Web-based environments due to its minimal requirements on the client's hardware and software. Our rapid encoding method uses a hierarchy of quantization to effectively reorder the original primitive data into several nested levels of detail. The resulting stateless buffer can progressively be transferred as-is to the GPU, where clustering is efficiently performed in parallel during rendering. We combine our approach with a crack-free mesh partitioning scheme to obtain a straightforward method for fast streaming and basic view-dependent LOD control.},

The primary goal was to find a practical and nonintrusive way to use potentially very different renderers in heterogeneous computing environments without impairing their strengths and without burdening the back-ends or the application with details of the cluster environment. Our approach is based on a mediator layer that handles multithreading, clustering, and the synchronization between the application's and the back-end's scene. We analyze the proposed approach with an implementation for a state-of-the-art distributed VR/AR system. In particular, we present two case studies and an example application.},

available models in this class, the geometric de-
scription of such features are also repeated.
A major distinctive aspect of our compression
technique is that repeating geometric features in the
geometric model are automatically discovered and
then compactly encoded. The proposed method dis-
covers repetition first at the connected component
level and then at the subcomponent level across
components and also at the aggregate component
level. The results from a straight forward imple-
mentation tried on large mesh models downloaded
from the net are extremely encouraging.},

Meanwhile, the large scale virtual scene cannot be successfully loaded in the entry-level client machine.

The experiment demonstrates that our method enables clients to enter the scene roaming and reduce the server network load. Meanwhile, it also adapts different network architectures.},

a slight change in the viewpoint might require the compu-

latency is inevitable.

a conservative superset of an  -neighborhood of a given

he moves within that  -neighborhood.},

Therefore, methods that allow combined visualization of terrain and geo-spatial vector data are required. Such methods have to adapt the vector data to the terrain surface and to ensure a precise and efficient mapping. In this paper, we present a method that is based on the stencil shadow volume algorithm and allows high-quality real-time overlay of vector data on virtual landscapes. Since the method is a screen-space algorithm it is per-pixel exact and does not suffer from aliasing artifacts like texture-based techniques. In addition, since the method is independent of the underlying terrain geometry, its performance does not depend on the complexity of the data set but only on the complexity of the vector data.},

In this paper, an extension to the popular shadow frustum culling algorithm is presented, which takes into account the fact that many planar occluders can be grouped into compound convex solids, which in turn can provide fewer and larger culling frusta and therefore more efficient elimination of hidden geometry. The proposed method combines planar and solid occluders using a unified selection approach and is ideal for dynamic environments, as it doesn’t depend on precalculated visibility data. The solid occluders culling algorithm has been applied to commercially deployed virtual reality systems and test cases and results are provided from actual virtual reality shows.},

The algorithm significantly improves on previous techniques by making better use of temporal and spatial coherence of visibility. This is achieved by using adaptive visibility prediction and query batching. As a result of the new optimizations the number of issued occlusion queries and the number of rendering state changes are significantly reduced. We also propose a simple method for determining tighter bounding volumes for occlusion queries and a method which further reduces the pipeline stalls. The proposed method provides up to an order of magnitude speedup over the previous state of the art. The new technique is simple to implement, does not rely on hardware calibration and integrates well with modern game engines.

The scene is then rendered using a traversal of the hierarchy in which a cell&#039;s approximation is drawn instead of its contents if the approximation is sufficiently accurate. We apply the method to several different scenes and demonstrate significant speedups with little image degradation.
