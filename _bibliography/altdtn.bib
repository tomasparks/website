  title     = {Towards an information-centric delay-tolerant network},
  year      = {2013},
  abstract  = {Information-centric networks (ICNs) have emerged as a prominent future Internet architecture. They work on the principle that, in today’s society, a network should be optimised towards the delivery of information, rather than the transit of messages between pre-determined end hosts. At the same time, another prominent research direction has been the delay-tolerant networking initiative, which argues that networks must explicitly support the tolerance of high delays and disruptions in end-to-end paths. We believe that this observation is pervasive across a number of applications and network technologies and should therefore be strongly considered in any future ICN designs. This paper explores the potential of combining these concepts into an information-centric delay-tolerant network (ICDTN). Through a qualitative and quantitative investigation, we present arguments in favour of the design, as well as important research challenges. I.},

  abstract  = {As the virtual world grows more complex, finding a standard way for storing data becomes in-
creasingly important. Ideally, each data item would be brought into the computer system only
once. References for data items need to be cryptographically verifiable, so the data can maintain
its identity while being passed around. This way there will be only one copy of the users family
photo album, while the user can use multiple tools to show or manipulate the album. Copies of
users data could be stored on some of his family members computer, some of his computers, but
also at some online services which he uses. When all actors operate over one replicated copy of the
data, the system automatically avoids a single point of failure. Thus the data will not disappear
with one computer breaking, or one service provider going out of business. One shared copy also
makes it possible to delete a piece of data from all systems at once, on users request.
In our research we tried to find a model that would make data manageable to users, and make
it possible to have the same data stored at various locations. We studied three systems, Persona,
Freenet, and GNUnet, that suggest different models for protecting user data. The main application
areas of the systems studied include securing online social networks, providing anonymous web,
and preventing censorship in file-sharing. Each of the systems studied store user data on machines
belonging to third parties. The systems differ in measures they take to protect their users from data
loss, forged information, censorship, and being monitored. All of the systems use cryptography to
secure names used for the content, and to protect the data from outsiders.
Based on the gained knowledge, we built a prototype platform called Peerscape, which stores user
data in a synchronized, protected database. Data items themselves are protected with cryptography
against forgery, but not encrypted as the focus has been disseminating the data directly among
family and friends instead of letting third parties store the information. We turned the synchronizing
database into peer-to-peer web by revealing its contents through an integrated http server. The
REST-like http API supports development of applications in javascript.

To evaluate the platform{\textquoteright}s suitability for application development we wrote some simple applica-
tions, including a public chat room, bittorrent site, and a flower growing game. During our early
tests we came to the conclusion that using the platform for simple applications works well. As web
standards develop further, writing applications for the platform should become easier. Any system
this complex will have its problems, and we are not expecting our platform to replace the existing
web, but are fairly impressed with the results and consider our work important from the perspective
of managing user data.

In particular, there are no trusted entities in the network. This paper describes an economic model to perform resource allocation and defend against malicious
participants in this context.  The approach presented does not use credentials or payments; rather, it is based on trust.  The design is much like that of a cooperative game in which peers take the role of players. Nodes must cooperate to achieve individual goals.  In such a scenario, it is important to be able to distinguish between nodes exhibiting friendly behavior and those exhibiting malicious behavior.

GNUnet aims to provide anonymity for its users.  Its design
makes it hard to link a transaction to the node where it originated from.  While anonymity requirements make a global view of the end-points of a transaction infeasible, the local link-to-link messages can be fully authenticated.  Our economic model is based entirely on this local view of the network and takes only local
decisions.

Implementations proposed in the literature so far have relied on state machine replication, and reach agreement on each individual set element in sequence.

We introduce set-union consensus, a specialization of Byzantine consensus that reaches agreement over whole sets. This primitive admits an efficient and simple implementation by the composition of Eppstein{\textquoteright}s set reconciliation protocol with Ben-Or{\textquoteright}s ByzConsensus protocol.

A free software implementation of this construction is available in GNUnet. Experimental results indicate that our approach results in an efficient protocol for very large sets, especially in the absence of Byzantine faults. We show the versatility of set-union consensus by using it to implement distributed key  generation, ballot collection and cooperative decryption for an electronic voting protocol implemented in GNUnet.

There are two main classes of PIR protocols: those that provide privacy guarantees based on the computational limitations of servers (CPIR) and those that rely on multiple servers not colluding for privacy (IT-PIR). These two classes have different advantages and disadvantages that make them more or less attractive to designers of PIR-enabled privacy enhancing technologies.
We present a hybrid PIR protocol that combines two PIR protocols, one from each of these classes. Our protocol inherits many positive aspects of both classes and mitigates some of the negative aspects. For example, our hybrid protocol maintains partial privacy when the security assumptions of one of the component protocols is broken, mitigating the privacy loss in such an event. We have implemented our protocol as an extension of the Percy++ library so that it combines a PIR protocol by Aguilar Melchor and Gaborit with one by Goldberg. We show that our hybrid protocol uses less communication than either of these component protocols and that our scheme is particularly beneficial when the number of records in a database is large compared to the size of the records. This situation arises in applications such as TLS certificate verification, anonymous communications systems, private LDAP lookups, and others.},

We show that none of them provides an adequate level of protection against an adversary with modest resources. Recognizing these flaws, we identify
security properties a censorship-resistant and privacy-preserving distributed web search engine should provide. We propose two novel defense mechanisms called node density protocol and webpage verification protocol to achieve censorship resistance and
show their effectiveness and feasibility with simulations. Finally, we elaborate on how state-of-the-art defense mechanisms achieve privacy protection in distributed web search engines.},

  abstract     = {Data obfuscation is a well-known technique for protecting user privacy against inference attacks, and it was studied in diverse settings, including search queries, recommender systems, location-based services and Online Social Networks (OSNs). However, these studies typically take the point of view of a single user who applies obfuscation, and focus on protection of a single target attribute. Unfortunately, while narrowing the scope simplifies the problem, it overlooks some significant challenges that effective obfuscation would need to address in a more realistic setting. First, correlations between attributes imply that obfuscation conducted to protect a certain attribute, may influence inference attacks targeted at other attributes. In addition, when multiple users conduct obfuscation simultaneously, the combined effect of their obfuscations may be significant enough to affect the inference mechanism to their detriment. In this work we focus on the OSN setting and use a dataset of 1.9 million Facebook profiles to demonstrate the severity of these problems and explore possible solutions. For example, we show that an obfuscation policy that would limit the accuracy of inference to 45\% when applied by a single user, would result in an inference accuracy of 75\% when applied by 10\% of the users. We show that a dynamic policy, which is continuously adjusted to the most recent data in the OSN, may mitigate this problem. Finally, we report the results of a user study, which indicates that users are more willing to obfuscate their profiles using popular and high quality items. Accordingly, we propose and evaluate an obfuscation strategy that satisfies both user needs and privacy protection.},

  abstract     = {Differential Privacy is one of the most prominent frameworks used to deal with disclosure prevention in statistical databases. It provides a formal privacy guarantee, ensuring that sensitive information relative to individuals cannot be easily inferred by disclosing answers to aggregate queries. If two databases are adjacent, i.e. differ only for an individual, then the query should not allow to tell them apart by more than a certain factor. This induces a bound also on the distinguishability of two generic databases, which is determined by their distance on the Hamming graph of the adjacency relation.
In this paper we explore the implications of differential privacy when the indistinguishability requirement depends on an arbitrary notion of distance. We show that we can naturally express, in this way, (protection against) privacy threats that cannot be represented with the standard notion, leading to new applications of the differential privacy framework. We give intuitive characterizations of these threats in terms of Bayesian adversaries, which generalize two interpretations of (standard) differential privacy from the literature. We revisit the well-known results stating that universally optimal mechanisms exist only for counting queries: We show that, in our extended setting, universally optimal mechanisms exist for other queries too, notably sum, average, and percentile queries. We explore various applications of the generalized definition, for statistical databases as well as for other areas, such that geolocation and smart metering.},

  abstract     = {P2P systems are inherently vulnerable to Sybil attacks, in which an attacker can have a large number of identities and use them to control a substantial fraction of the system. We propose Persea, a novel P2P system that is more robust against Sybil attacks than prior approaches. Persea derives its Sybil resistance by assigning IDs through a bootstrap tree, the graph of how nodes have joined the system through invitations. More specifically, a node joins Persea when it gets an invitation from an existing node in the system. The inviting node assigns a node ID to the joining node and gives it a chunk of node IDs for further distribution. For each chunk of ID space, the attacker needs to socially engineer a connection to another node already in the system. This hierarchical distribution of node IDs confines a large attacker botnet to a considerably smaller region of the ID space than in a normal P2P system. Persea uses a replication mechanism in which each (key,value) pair is stored in nodes that are evenly spaced over the network. Thus, even if a given region is occupied by attackers, the desired (key,value) pair can be retrieved from other regions. We compare our results with Kad, Whanau, and X-Vine and show that Persea is a better solution against Sybil attacks. collapse},

  abstract  = {Although the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) using X.509 is meant to prevent the occurrence of man-in-the-middle attacks on TLS, there are still situations in which such attacks are possible due to the large number of Certification Authorities (CA) that has to be trusted. Recent incidents involving CA compromises, which lead to issuance of rogue certificates indicate the weakness of the PKI model. Recently various public key pinning protocols {\textendash} such as DANE or TACK {\textendash} have been proposed to thwart man-in-the-middle attacks on TLS connections. It will take a longer time, however, until any of these protocols reach wide deployment. We present an approach intended as an interim solution to bridge this gap and provide protection for connections to servers not yet using a pinning protocol. The presented method is based on public key pinning with a trust on first use model, and can be combined with existing notary approaches as well.},

  abstract  = {SPDY is a rather new protocol which is an alternative to HTTP. It was designed to address inefficiencies in the latter and thereby improve latency and reduce bandwidth consumption.

This thesis presents the design and implementation of a setup for utilizing SPDY within the anonymizing Tor network for reducing latency and traffic in the latter. A C library implementing the SPDY server protocol is introduced together with an HTTP to SPDY and a SPDY to HTTP proxy which are the base for the presented design.

Furthermore, we focus on the SPDY server push feature which allows servers to send multiple responses to a single request for reducing latency and traffic on loading web pages. We propose a prediction algorithm for employing push at SPDY servers and proxies. The algorithm makes predictions based on previous requests and responses and initially does not know anything about the data which it will push.

This thesis includes extensive measurement data highlighting the possible benefits of using SPDY instead of HTTP and HTTPS (1.0 or 1.1), especially with respect to networks experiencing latency or loss. Moreover, the real profit from using SPDY within the Tor network on loading some of the most popular web sites is presented. Finally, evaluations of the proposed push prediction algorithm are given for emphasizing the possible gain of employing it at SPDY reverse and forward proxies.

  abstract  = {The Web has become a user-centric platform where users post, share, annotate, comment and forward content be it text, videos, pictures, URLs, etc. This social dimension creates tremendous new opportunities for information exchange over the Internet, as exemplified by the surprising and exponential growth of social networks and collaborative platforms. Yet, niche content is sometimes difficult to retrieve using traditional search engines because they target the mass rather than the individual. Likewise, relieving users from useless notification is tricky in a world where there is so much information and so little of interest for each and every one of us. We argue that ultra-specific content could be retrieved and disseminated should search and notification be personalized to fit this new setting. We also argue that users{\textquoteright} interests should be implicitly captured by the system rather than relying on explicit classifications simply because the world is by nature unstructured, dynamic and users do not want to be hampered in their actions by a tight and static framework. In this paper, we review some existing personalization approaches, most of which are centralized. We then advocate the need for fully decentralized systems because personalization raises two main issues. Firstly, personalization requires information to be stored and maintained at a user granularity which can significantly hurt the scalability of a centralized solution. Secondly, at a time when the {\textquoteleft}big brother is watching you{\textquoteright} attitude is prominent, users may be more and more reluctant to give away their personal data to the few large companies that can afford such personalization. We start by showing how to achieve personalization in decentralized systems and conclude with the research agenda ahead.},

We report on an extensive evaluation of WHATSUP through (a) simulations, (b) a ModelNet emulation on a cluster, and (c) a PlanetLab deployment based on real datasets. We show that WHATSUP outperforms various alternatives in terms of accurate and complete delivery of relevant news items while preserving the fundamental advantages of standard gossip: namely, simplicity of deployment and robustness.},

In particular, we aim at providing a high level of privacy with respect to the profile even if a potentially unbounded number of similarity computations take place, thus calling for a non-interactive mechanism. To achieve this, we propose a novel non-interactive differentially private mechanism called BLIP (for BLoom-and-flIP) for randomizing Bloom filters. This approach relies on a bit flipping mechanism and offers high privacy guarantees while maintaining a small communication cost. Another advantage of this non-interactive mechanism is that similarity computation can take place even when the user is offline, which is impossible to achieve with interactive mechanisms. Another of our contributions is the definition of a probabilistic inference attack, called the {\textquotedblleft}Profile Reconstruction attack{\textquotedblright}, that can be used to reconstruct the profile of an individual from his Bloom filter representation. More specifically, we provide an analysis of the protection offered by BLIP against this profile reconstruction attack by deriving an upper and lower bound for the required value of the differential privacy parameter ε.},

serve that some nodes persist in being under-utilized or congested. This can degrade the network{\textquoteright}s performance, discourage Tor adoption, and consequently reduce the size of Tor{\textquoteright}s anonymity set. In an effort to reduce congestion and improve load balancing, we propose a congestion-aware path selection algorithm. Using latency as an indicator of congestion, clients use opportunistic and lightweight active measurements to evaluate the congestion state of nodes, and reject nodes that appear congested. Through experiments conducted on the live Tor network, we verify our hypothesis that clients can infer congestion using latency and show that congestion-aware path selection can improve performance.

  abstract  = {While the Internet was conceived as a decentralized network, the most widely used web applications today tend toward centralization. Control increasingly rests with centralized service providers who, as a consequence, have also amassed unprecedented amounts of data about the behaviors and personalities of individuals. 
Developers, regulators, and consumer advocates have looked to alternative decentralized architectures as the natural response to threats posed by these centralized services. The result has been a great variety of solutions that include personal data stores (PDS), infomediaries, Vendor Relationship Management (VRM) systems, and federated and distributed social networks. And yet, for all these efforts, decentralized personal data architectures have seen little adoption.
This position paper attempts to account for these failures, challenging the accepted wisdom in the web community on the feasibility and desirability of these approaches. We start with a historical discussion of the development of various categories of decentralized personal data architectures. Then we survey the main ideas to illustrate the common themes among these efforts. We tease apart the design characteristics of these systems from the social values that they (are intended to) promote. We use this understanding to point out numerous drawbacks of the decentralization paradigm, some inherent and others incidental. We end with recommendations for designers of these systems for working towards goals that are achievable, but perhaps more limited in scope and ambition.},

Bosley and Dodis (TCC{\textquoteright}07) showed that if a source of randomness R is {\textquotedblleft}good enough{\textquotedblright} to generate a secret key capable of encrypting k bits, then one can deterministically extract nearly k almost uniform bits from R, suggesting that traditional privacy notions (namely, indistinguishability of encryption) requires an {\textquotedblleft}extractable{\textquotedblright} source of randomness. Other, even stronger impossibility results are known for achieving privacy under specific {\textquotedblleft}non-extractable{\textquotedblright} sources of randomness, such as the γ-Santha-Vazirani (SV) source, where each next bit has fresh entropy, but is allowed to have a small bias γ < 1 (possibly depending on prior bits).
We ask whether similar negative results also hold for a more recent notion of privacy called differential privacy (Dwork et al., TCC{\textquoteright}06), concentrating, in particular, on achieving differential privacy with the Santha-Vazirani source. We show that the answer is no. Specifically, we give a differentially private mechanism for approximating arbitrary {\textquotedblleft}low sensitivity{\textquotedblright} functions that works even with randomness coming from a γ-Santha-Vazirani source, for any γ < 1. This provides a somewhat surprising {\textquotedblleft}separation{\textquotedblright} between traditional privacy and differential privacy with respect to imperfect randomness.
Interestingly, the design of our mechanism is quite different from the traditional {\textquotedblleft}additive-noise{\textquotedblright} mechanisms (e.g., Laplace mechanism) successfully utilized to achieve differential privacy with perfect randomness. Indeed, we show that any (non-trivial) {\textquotedblleft}SV-robust{\textquotedblright} mechanism for our problem requires a demanding property called consistent sampling, which is strictly stronger than differential privacy, and cannot be satisfied by any additive-noise mechanism.},

However, user-tracking is a concern with such location-based services, not only because location data can be linked uniquely to individuals, but because the low-level nature of current location APIs and the resulting dependence on the cloud to synthesize useful representations virtually guarantees such tracking.
In this paper, we propose privacy-preserving location-based matching as a fundamental platform primitive and as an alternative to exposing low-level, latitude-longitude (lat-long) coordinates to applications. Applications set rich location-based triggers and have these be fired based on location updates either from the local device or from a remote device (e.g., a friend{\textquoteright}s phone). Our Koi platform, comprising a privacy-preserving matching service in the cloud and a phone-based agent, realizes this primitive across multiple phone and browser platforms. By masking low-level lat-long information from applications, Koi not only avoids leaking privacy-sensitive information, it also eases the task of programmers by providing a higher-level abstraction that is easier for applications to build upon. Koi{\textquoteright}s privacy-preserving protocol prevents the cloud service from tracking users. We verify the non-tracking properties of Koi using a theorem prover, illustrate how privacy guarantees can easily be added to a wide range of location-based applications, and show that our public deployment is performant, being able to perform 12K matches per second on a single core.},

As a result, increased end-to-end latency renders such systems inadequate for the majority of Internet users who seek an intermediate level of anonymity protection while using latency-sensitive applications, such as Web applications. This paper serves to bridge the gap between communication systems that provide strong anonymity protection but with intolerable latency and non-anonymous communication systems by considering a new design space for the setting. More specifically, we explore how to achieve near-optimal latency while achieving an intermediate level of anonymity with a weaker yet practical adversary model (i.e., protecting an end-host{\textquoteright}s identity and location from servers)
such that users can choose between the level of anonymity and usability. We propose Lightweight Anonymity and Privacy (LAP), an efficient network-based solution featuring lightweight path establishment and stateless communication, by concealing an end-host{\textquoteright}s topological location to enhance anonymity against
remote tracking. To show practicality, we demonstrate that LAP can work on top of the current Internet and proposed future Internet architectures.

  abstract     = {The widely used Tor anonymity network is designed
to enable low-latency anonymous communication. However, in
practice, interactive communication on Tor{\textemdash}which accounts for
over 90\% of connections in the Tor network [1]{\textemdash}incurs latencies
over 5x greater than on the direct Internet path. In addition, since
path selection to establish a circuit in Tor is oblivious to Internet
routing, anonymity guarantees can breakdown in cases where an
autonomous system (AS) can correlate traffic across the entry
and exit segments of a circuit.
In this paper, we show that both of these shortcomings in Tor
can be addressed with only client-side modifications, i.e., without
requiring a revamp of the entire Tor architecture. To this end,
we design and implement a new Tor client, LASTor. First, we
show that LASTor can deliver significant latency gains over the
default Tor client by simply accounting for the inferred locations
of Tor relays while choosing paths. Second, since the preference
for low latency paths reduces the entropy of path selection,
we design LASTor{\textquoteright}s path selection algorithm to be tunable. A
user can choose an appropriate tradeoff between latency and
anonymity by specifying a value between 0 (lowest latency) and
1 (highest anonymity) for a single parameter. Lastly, we develop
an efficient and accurate algorithm to identify paths on which
an AS can correlate traffic between the entry and exit segments.
This algorithm enables LASTor to avoid such paths and improve a
user{\textquoteright}s anonymity, while the low runtime of the algorithm ensures
that the impact on end-to-end latency of communication is low.
By applying our techniques to measurements of real Internet
paths and by using LASTor to visit the top 200 websites from
several geographically-distributed end-hosts, we show that, in
comparison to the default Tor client, LASTor reduces median
latencies by 25\% while also reducing the false negative rate of
not detecting a potential snooping AS from 57\% to 11\%.

  abstract     = {This paper is about private data analysis, in which a trusted curator holding a confidential database responds to real vector-valued queries. A common approach to ensuring privacy for the database elements is to add appropriately generated random noise to the answers, releasing only these noisy responses. A line of study initiated in [7] examines the amount of distortion needed to prevent privacy violations of various kinds. The results in the literature vary according to several parameters, including the size of the database, the size of the universe from which data elements are drawn, the {\textquotedblleft}amount{\textquotedblright} of privacy desired, and for the purposes of the current work, the arity of the query. In this paper we sharpen and unify these bounds. Our foremost result combines the techniques of Hardt and Talwar [11] and McGregor et al. [13] to obtain linear lower bounds on distortion when providing differential privacy for a (contrived) class of low-sensitivity queries. (A query has low sensitivity if the data of a single individual has small effect on the answer.) Several structural results follow as immediate corollaries:
We separate so-called counting queries from arbitrary low-sensitivity queries, proving the latter requires more noise, or distortion, than does the former;
We separate (ε,0)-differential privacy from its well-studied relaxation (ε,δ)-differential privacy, even when δ ∈ 2- o(n) is negligible in the size n of the database, proving the latter requires less distortion than the former;
We demonstrate that (ε,δ)-differential privacy is much weaker than (ε,0)-differential privacy in terms of mutual information of the transcript of the mechanism with the database, even when δ ∈ 2- o(n) is negligible in the size n of the database.
We also simplify the lower bounds on noise for counting queries in [11] and also make them unconditional. Further, we use a characterization of (ε,δ) differential privacy from [13] to obtain lower bounds on the distortion needed to ensure (ε,δ)-differential privacy for ε,δ > 0. We next revisit the LP decoding argument of [10] and combine it with a recent result of Rudelson [15] to improve on a result of Kasiviswanathan et al. [12] on noise lower bounds for privately releasing l-way marginals.},

Debugging distributed systems is more complex due to time dependencies between interacting processes. Another related problem is duplicate bug reports in bug repositories. Finding bug duplicates is hard and wastes developers{\textquoteright} time which may affect the development team{\textquoteright}s rate of bug fixes and new releases.
In this master thesis we introduce Monkey, a new tool that provides a solution for automated classification, investigation and characterization of bugs, as well as a solution for comparing bug reports and avoiding duplicates. Our tool is particularly suitable for distributed systems due to its autonomy. We present Monkey{\textquoteright}s key design goals and architecture and give experimental results demonstrating the viability of our approach.},

Existing solutions for NAT traversal can remedy the restrictions, but still there is a fraction of home users which lack support of it, especially when it comes to TCP. We present a framework
for traversing NAT routers by exploiting their built-in FTP and IRC application-level gateways (ALG) for arbitrary TCP-based applications. While this does not work in every scenario, it
significantly improves the success chance without requiring any user interaction at all. To demonstrate the framework, we show
a small test setup with laptop computers and home NAT routers.

We provide the first comprehensive analysis of general-purpose TA countermeasures. We show that nine known countermeasures are vulnerable to simple attacks that exploit coarse features of traffic (e.g., total time and bandwidth). The considered countermeasures
include ones like those standardized by TLS, SSH, and IPsec, and even more complex ones like the traffic morphing scheme of Wright et al. As just one of our results, we show that despite the use of traffic morphing, one can use only
total upstream and downstream bandwidth to identify {\textemdash}with 98\% accuracy{\textemdash} which of two websites was visited. One implication of what we find is that, in the context of website identification, it is unlikely that bandwidth-efficient, general-
purpose TA countermeasures can ever provide the type of security targeted in prior work.

Tables (DHTs) that efficiently processes range queries and ensures access load balancing and fault-tolerance. Placing consecutive
data values in neighboring peers is desirable in DHTs since it accelerates range query processing; however, such a placement is highly
susceptible to load imbalances. At the same time, DHTs may be susceptible to node departures/failures and high data availability and
fault tolerance are significant issues. Saturn deals effectively with these problems through the introduction of a novel multiple ring,
order-preserving architecture. The use of a novel order-preserving hash function ensures fast range query processing. Replication
across and within data rings (termed vertical and horizontal replication) forms the foundation over which our mechanisms are
developed, ensuring query load balancing and fault tolerance, respectively. Our detailed experimentation study shows strong gains in
range query processing efficiency, access load balancing, and fault tolerance, with low replication overheads. The significance of
Saturn is not only that it effectively tackles all three issues together{\textemdash}i.e., supporting range queries, ensuring load balancing, and
providing fault tolerance over DHTs{\textemdash}but also that it can be applied on top of any order-preserving DHT enabling it to dynamically
handle replication and, thus, to trade off replication costs for fair load distribution and fault tolerance.

Web based social networks have become typical platforms for extracting user interests. In addition, there are various types of interests from these social networks. In this paper, we provide an algorithmic framework for retrieving semantic data based on user interests from multiple sources (such as multiple social networking sites). We design several algorithms to deal with interests based retrieval based on single and multiple types of interests. We utilize publication data from Semantic Web Dog Food (which can be considered as an academic collaboration based social network), and microblogging data from Twitter to validate our framework.

We identify situations where its inaccuracy is acute, and reveal a better anonymity indicator. Also, by constructing an information-preserving embedding of a smaller class of attacks into the wider class for which this metric was proposed, we show that this metric fails to possess desirable
generalization properties. Finally, we present a new anonymity metric that does not exhibit these shortcomings. Our new metric is accurate as well as general.

Two recently proposed schemes, Nymbler and Jack, reduce the trust placed in these third parties at the expense of using less-efficient asymmetric crypto primitives. We present BNymble, a scheme which matches the anonymity guarantees of Nymbler and Jack while (nearly) maintaining the efficiency of the original Nymble. The key insight of
BNymble is that we can achieve the anonymity goals of these more recent schemes by replacing only the infrequent {\textquotedblleft}User Registration{\textquotedblright} protocol from Nymble with asymmetric primitives. We prove the security of BNymble, and report on its efficiency.

  abstract     = {Tor is a network designed for low-latency anonymous communications. Tor clients form circuits through relays that are listed in a public directory, and then relay their encrypted traffic through these circuits. This indirection makes it difficult for a local adversary to determine with whom a particular Tor user is communicating. In response, some local adversaries restrict access to Tor by blocking each of the publicly listed relays. To deal with such an adversary, Tor uses bridges, which are unlisted relays that can be used as alternative entry points into the Tor network. Unfortunately, issues with Tor{\textquoteright}s bridge implementation make it easy to discover large numbers of bridges. An adversary that hoards this information may use it to determine when each bridge is online over time. If a bridge operator also browses with Tor on the same machine, this information may be sufficient to deanonymize him. We present BridgeSPA as a method to mitigate this issue. A client using BridgeSPA relies on innocuous single packet authorization (SPA) to present a time-limited key to a bridge. Before this authorization takes place, the bridge will not reveal whether it is online. We have implemented BridgeSPA as a working proof-of-concept, which is available under an open-source licence.

Anonymous communication systems allow users to conceal the destinations they communicate with, but do not hide the fact that the users are using them. The mere use of such systems may invite suspicion, or access to them may be blocked.
We therefore propose Cirripede, a system that can be used for unobservable communication with Internet destinations. Cirripede is designed to be deployed by ISPs; it intercepts connections from clients to innocent-looking destinations and redirects them to the true destination requested by the client. The communication is encoded in a way that is indistinguishable from normal communications to anyone without the master secret key, while public-key cryptography is used to eliminate the need for any secret information that must be shared with Cirripede users.
Cirripede is designed to work scalably with routers that handle large volumes of traffic while imposing minimal overhead on ISPs and not disrupting existing traffic. This allows Cirripede proxies to be strategically deployed at central locations, making access to Cirripede very difficult to block. We built a proof-of-concept implementation of Cirripede and performed a testbed evaluation of its performance properties.

While Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) can provide very efficient look-up operations, they traditionally do not provide any methods for complex queries. By exploiting the structure inherent in DHTs we can perform complex querying over structured P2P networks by means of efficiently broadcasting the search query. This allows every node in the network to process the query locally, and hence is as powerful and flexible as flooding in unstructured networks, but without the inefficiency of redundant messages. While there have been various approaches proposed for broadcasting search queries over DHTs, the focus has not been on validation under churn. Comparing blind search methods for DHTs though simulation we see that churn, in particular nodes leaving the network, has a large impact on query success rate. In this paper we present novel results comparing blind search over Chord and Pastry while under varying levels of churn. We further consider how different data replication strategies can be used to enhance the query success rate.},

While conventional wisdom dictates that the level of anonymity offered by Tor increases as its user base grows, the most significant obstacle to Tor adoption continues to be its slow performance. We seek to enhance Tor{\textquoteright}s performance by offering techniques to control congestion and improve flow control, thereby reducing unnecessary delays. To reduce congestion, we first evaluate small fixed-size circuit windows and a dynamic circuit window that adaptively re-sizes in response to perceived congestion. While these solutions improve web page response times and require modification only to exit routers, they generally offer poor flow control and slower downloads relative to Tor{\textquoteright}s current design. To improve flow control while reducing congestion, we implement N23, an ATM-style per-link algorithm that allows Tor routers to explicitly cap their queue lengths and signal congestion via back-pressure. Our results show that N23 offers better congestion and flow control, resulting in improved web page response times and faster page loads compared to Tor{\textquoteright}s current design and other window-based approaches. We also argue that our proposals do not enable any new attacks on Tor users{\textquoteright} privacy.

While in both the goal is to privately evaluate some function of the individual inputs, the privacy requirements are significantly different. The general feasibility results for SFE suggest a natural paradigm for implementing differentially private analyses distributively: First choose what to compute, i.e., a differentially private analysis; Then decide how to compute it, i.e., construct an SFE protocol for this analysis. 
We initiate an examination whether there are advantages to a paradigm where both decisions are made simultaneously. In particular, we investigate under which accuracy requirements it is beneficial to adapt this paradigm for computing a collection of functions including binary sum, gap threshold, and approximate median queries. Our results imply that when computing the binary sum of n distributed inputs then: 
* When we require that the error is o(n√) and the number of rounds is constant, there is no benefit in the new paradigm. 
* When we allow an error of O(n√), the new paradigm yields more efficient protocols when we consider protocols that compute symmetric functions. 
Our results also yield new separations between the local and global models of computations for private data analysis.},

Unfortunately, Tor often exhibits poor performance due to congestion caused by the unbalanced ratio of clients to available relays, as well as a disproportionately high consumption of network capacity by a small fraction of filesharing users.
This paper argues the very counterintuitive notion that slowing down traffic on Tor will increase the bandwidth capacity of the network and consequently improve the experience of interactive web users. We introduce Tortoise, a system for rate limiting Tor at its ingress points. We demonstrate that Tortoise incurs little penalty for interactive web users, while significantly decreasing the throughput for filesharers. Our techniques provide incentives to filesharers to configure their Tor clients to also relay traffic, which in turn improves the network{\textquoteright}s overall performance. We present large-scale emulation results that indicate that interactive users will achieve a significant speedup if even a small fraction of clients opt to run relays.

The state-of-the-art traffic watermarking schemes are usually based on packet timing information and they are notoriously difficult to detect. In this paper, we show for the first time that even the most sophisticated timing-based watermarking schemes (e.g., RAINBOW and SWIRL) are not invisible by proposing a new detection system called BACKLIT. BACKLIT is designed according to the observation that any practical timing-based traffic watermark will cause noticeable alterations in the intrinsic timing features typical of TCP flows. We propose five metrics that are sufficient for detecting four state-of-the-art traffic watermarks for bulk transfer and interactive traffic. BACKLIT can be easily deployed in stepping stones and anonymity networks (e.g., Tor), because it does not rely on strong assumptions and can be realized in an active or passive mode. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate BACKLIT{\textquoteright}s detection performance using the PlanetLab platform. The results show that BACKLIT can detect watermarked network flows
with high accuracy and few false positives.

We demonstrate several flaws in OneSwarm{\textquoteright}s design and implementation through three different attacks available to forensic investigators. First, we prove that the current design is vulnerable to a novel timing attack that allows just two attackers attached to the same target to determine if it is the source of queried content. When attackers comprise 15\% of OneSwarm peers, we expect over 90\% of remaining peers will be attached to two attackers and therefore vulnerable. Thwarting the attack increases OneSwarm query response times, making them longer than the equivalent in Onion Routing. Second, we show that OneSwarm{\textquoteright}s vulnerability to traffic analysis by colluding attackers is much greater than was previously reported, and is much worse than Onion Routing. We show for this second attack that when investigators comprise 25\% of peers, over 40\% of the network can be investigated with 80\% precision to find the sources of content. Our examination of the OneSwarm source code found differences with the technical paper that significantly reduce security. For the implementation in use by thousands of people, attackers that comprise 25\% of the network can successfully use this second attack against 98\% of remaining peers with 95\% precision. Finally, we show that a novel application of a known TCP-based attack allows a single attacker to identify whether a neighbor is the source of data or a proxy for it. Users that turn off the default rate-limit setting are exposed. Each attack can be repeated as investigators leave and rejoin the network. All of our attacks are successful in a forensics context: Law enforcement can use them legally ahead of a warrant. Furthermore, private investigators, who have fewer restrictions on their behavior, can use them more easily in pursuit of evidence for such civil suits as copyright infringement.},

  abstract  = {Anonymous communications networks, such as Tor, help to solve the real and important problem of enabling users to communicate privately over the Internet. However, in doing so, anonymous communications networks introduce an entirely new problem for the service providers{\textemdash}such as websites, IRC networks or mail servers{\textemdash}with which these users interact; in particular, since all anonymous users look alike, there is no way for the service providers to hold individual misbehaving anonymous users accountable for their actions. Recent
research efforts have focused on using anonymous blacklisting systems (which are sometimes called anonymous revocation systems) to empower service providers with the ability to revoke access from abusive anonymous users. In contrast to revocable anonymity systems, which enable some trusted third party to deanonymize users, anonymous blacklisting systems provide users with a way to authenticate anonymously with a service provider, while enabling the service provider to revoke access from any users that misbehave, without revealing their identities. In this paper, we introduce the anonymous blacklisting
problem and survey the literature on anonymous blacklisting systems, comparing and contrasting the architecture of various existing schemes, and discussing the tradeoffs inherent with each design. The literature on anonymous blacklisting systems lacks a unified set of definitions; each scheme operates under different trust assumptions and provides different security and privacy guarantees. Therefore, before we discuss the existing approaches in detail, we first propose a formal definition for anonymous blacklisting systems, and a set of security and privacy properties that these systems should possess. We also
outline a set of new performance requirements that anonymous blacklisting systems should satisfy to maximize their potential for real-world adoption, and give formal definitions for several optional features already supported by some schemes in the literature.

Although the privacy parameter ε in differential privacy is used to quantify the privacy risk posed by releasing statistics computed on sensitive data, ε is not an absolute measure of privacy but rather a relative measure. In effect, even for the same value of ε , the privacy guarantees enforced by differential privacy are different based on the domain of attribute in question and the query supported.

However, the most significant obstacle to increased adoption of such systems is that their security and performance properties are perceived to be weak. In an effort to help foster adoption, this dissertation aims to better understand and improve security, anonymity, and performance in low latency anonymous communication systems.

To better understand the security and performance properties of a popular low latency anonymity network, we characterize Tor, focusing on its application protocol distribution, geopolitical client and router distributions, and performance. For instance, we observe that peer-to-peer file sharing protocols use an unfair portion of the network{\textquoteright}s scarce bandwidth. To reduce the congestion produced by bulk downloaders in networks such as Tor, we design, implement, and analyze an anonymizing network tailored specifically for the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. We next analyze Tor{\textquoteright}s security and anonymity properties and empirically show that Tor is vulnerable to practical end-to-end traffic correlation attacks launched by relatively weak adversaries that inflate their bandwidth claims to attract traffic and thereby compromise key positions on clients{\textquoteright} paths. We also explore the security and performance trade-offs that revolve around path length design decisions and we show that shorter paths offer performance benefits and provide increased resilience to certain attacks. Finally, we discover a source of performance degradation in Tor that results from poor congestion and flow control. To improve Tor{\textquoteright}s performance and grow its user base, we offer a fresh approach to congestion and flow control inspired by techniques from IP and ATM networks.},

Unlike most multi-party privacy-preserving data mining algorithms, this approach works in an asynchronous manner through local interactions and it is highly scalable. It particularly deals with the distributed computation of the sum of a set of numbers stored at different peers in a P2P network in the context of a P2P web mining application. The proposed optimization-based privacy-preserving technique for computing the sum allows different peers to specify different privacy requirements without having to adhere to a global set of parameters for the chosen privacy model. Since distributed sum computation is a frequently used primitive, the proposed approach is likely to have significant impact on many data mining tasks such as multi-party privacy-preserving clustering, frequent itemset mining, and statistical aggregate computation.},

However, Tor does not protect against the exploitation of an insecure application to reveal the IP address of, or trace, a TCP stream. In addition, because of the linkability of Tor streams sent together over a single circuit, tracing one stream sent over a circuit traces them all. Surprisingly, it is unknown whether this linkability allows in practice to trace a significant number of streams originating from secure (i.e., proxied) applications. In this paper, we show that linkability allows us to trace 193\% of additional streams, including 27\% of HTTP streams possibly originating from {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}secure{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} browsers. In particular, we traced 9\% of Tor streams carried by our instrumented exit nodes. Using BitTorrent as the insecure application, we design two attacks tracing BitTorrent users on Tor. We run these attacks in the wild for 23 days and reveal 10,000 IP addresses of Tor users. Using these IP addresses, we then profile not only the BitTorrent downloads but also the websites visited per country of origin of Tor users. We show that BitTorrent users on Tor are over-represented in some countries as compared to BitTorrent users outside of Tor. By analyzing the type of content downloaded, we then explain the observed behaviors by the higher concentration of pornographic content downloaded at the scale of a country. Finally, we present results suggesting the existence of an underground BitTorrent ecosystem on Tor.},

  abstract  = {Several anonymous authentication schemes allow servers to revoke a misbehaving user{\textquoteright}s future accesses.
Traditionally, these schemes have relied on powerful Trusted Third Parties (TTPs) capable of deanonymizing
(or linking) users{\textquoteright} connections. Such TTPs are undesirable because users{\textquoteright} anonymity is not guaranteed, and users must trust them to judge {\textquoteleft}misbehavior{\textquoteright} fairly. Recent schemes such as Blacklistable Anonymous Credentials (BLAC) and Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID) support {\textquotedblleft}privacy-enhanced revocation{\textquotedblright} {\textemdash} servers can revoke misbehaving users without a TTP{\textquoteright}s involvement, and without learning the revoked users{\textquoteright} identities.
In BLAC and EPID, however, the computation required for authentication at the server is linear in the size (L) of the revocation list, which is impractical as the size approaches thousands of entries. We propose PEREA, a new anonymous authentication scheme for which this bottleneck of computation is independent of the size of the revocation list. Instead, the time complexity of authentication is linear in the size of a revocation window K L, the number of subsequent authentications before which a user{\textquoteright}s misbehavior must be recognized if the user is to be revoked. We extend PEREA to support more complex revocation policies that take the severity of misbehaviors into account. Users can authenticate anonymously if their naughtiness, i.e., the sum of the severities of their blacklisted misbehaviors, is below a certain naughtiness threshold.
We call our extension PEREA-Naughtiness. We prove the security of our constructions, and validate their efficiency as compared to BLAC both analytically and quantitatively.

  abstract  = {Existing anonymous communication systems like Tor do not scale well as they require all users to maintain up-to-date information about all available Tor relays in the system. Current proposals for scaling anonymous communication advocate a peer-to-peer (P2P) approach. While the P2P paradigm scales to millions of nodes, it provides new opportunities to compromise anonymity. In this paper, we step away from the P2P paradigm and advocate a client-server approach to scalable anonymity. We propose PIR-Tor, an architecture for the Tor network in which users obtain information about only a few onion routers using private information retrieval techniques. Obtaining information about only a few onion routers is the key to the scalability of our approach, while the use of private retrieval information techniques helps preserve client anonymity. The security of our architecture depends on the security of PIR schemes which are
well understood and relatively easy to analyze, as opposed to peer-to-peer designs that require analyzing extremely complex and dynamic systems. In particular, we demonstrate that reasonable parameters of our architecture provide equivalent security to that of the Tor network. Moreover, our experimental results show that the overhead of PIR-Tor is manageable even when the Tor network scales by two orders of magnitude.

to their profiles) while preserving their privacy in a fully decentralized system and for the passive adversary
model. First, we introduce a two-party protocol for privately computing a threshold version of the similarity and apply it to well-known similarity measures such as the scalar product and the cosine similarity. The output of this protocol is only one bit of information telling whether or not two users are similar beyond a predetermined threshold. Afterwards, we explore the computation of the exact and threshold similarity within the context of differential privacy. Differential privacy is a recent notion developed within the field of private data analysis guaranteeing that an adversary that observes the output of the differentially
private mechanism, will only gain a negligible advantage (up to a privacy parameter) from the presence (or absence) of a particular item in the profile of a user. This provides a strong privacy guarantee that holds independently of the auxiliary knowledge that the adversary might have. More specifically, we design several differentially private variants of the exact and threshold protocols that rely on the addition of random noise tailored to the sensitivity of the considered similarity measure. We also analyze their complexity as well as their impact on the utility of the resulting similarity measure. Finally, we provide experimental results validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach on real datasets.},

Unfortunately, the dissemination channels used to distribute proxy server locations are increasingly being monitored to discover and quickly block these proxies. This has given rise to a large number of ad hoc dissemination channels that leverage trust networks to reach legitimate users and at the same time prevent proxy server addresses from falling into the hands of censors. To address this problem in a more principled manner, we present Proximax, a robust system that continuously distributes pools of proxies to a large number of channels. The key research challenge in Proximax is to distribute the proxies among the different channels in a way that maximizes the usage of these proxies while minimizing the risk of having them blocked. This is challenging because of two conflicting goals: widely disseminating the location of the proxies to fully utilize their capacity and preventing (or at least delaying) their discovery by censors. We present a practical system that lays out a design and analytical model that balances these factors.

  abstract     = {Differential privacy is a notion that has emerged in the community of statistical databases, as a response to the problem of protecting the privacy of the database{\textquoteright}s participants when performing statistical queries. The idea is that a randomized query satisfies differential privacy if the likelihood of obtaining a certain answer for a database x is not too different from the likelihood of obtaining the same answer on adjacent databases, i.e. databases which differ from x for only one individual. Information flow is an area of Security concerned with the problem of controlling the leakage of confidential information in programs and protocols. Nowadays, one of the most established approaches to quantify and to reason about leakage is based on the R ́enyi min entropy version of information theory.

In this paper, we analyze critically the notion of differential privacy in light of the conceptual framework provided by the R ́enyi min information theory. We show that there is a close relation between differential
privacy and leakage, due to the graph symmetries induced by the adjacency relation. Furthermore, we consider the utility of the randomized answer, which measures its expected degree of accuracy. We focus on certain kinds of utility functions called {\textquotedblleft}binary{\textquotedblright}, which have a close correspondence with the R ́enyi min mutual information. Again, it turns out that there can be a tight correspondence between differential privacy and utility, depending on the symmetries induced by the adjacency relation and by the query. Depending on these symmetries we can also build an optimal-utility randomization mechanism while preserving the required level of differential privacy. Our main contribution is a study of the kind of structures that can be induced by the adjacency relation and the query, and how to use them to derive bounds on the leakage and achieve the optimal utility.},

These attacks exploit cryptosystem or protocol implementations that do not run in constant time. When implementing an elliptic curve cryptosystem with a goal to provide side-channel resistance, the scalar multiplication routine is a critical component. In such instances, one attractive method often suggested in the literature is Montgomery{\textquoteright}s ladder that performs a fixed sequence of curve and field operations. This paper describes a timing attack vulnerability in OpenSSL{\textquoteright}s ladder implementation for curves over binary fields. We use this vulnerability to steal the private key of a TLS server where the server authenticates with ECDSA signatures. Using the timing of the exchanged messages, the messages themselves, and the signatures, we mount a lattice attack that recovers the private key. Finally, we describe and implement an effective countermeasure.},

  abstract  = {When selfish industries are competing for limited shared resources, they need to coordinate their activities to handle possible conflicting situations. Moreover, this coordination should not affect the activities already planned by the industries, since this could have negative effects on their performance. Although agents may have buffers that allow them to delay the use of resources, these are of a finite capacity, and therefore cannot be used indiscriminately. Thus, we are faced with the problem of coordinating schedules that have already been generated by the agents. To address this task, we propose to use a recurrent auction mechanism to mediate between the agents. Through this auction mechanism, the agents can express their interest in using the resources, thus helping the scheduler to find the best distribution. We also introduce a priority mechanism to add fairness to the coordination process. The proposed coordination mechanism has been applied to a waste water treatment system scenario, where different industries need to discharge their waste. We have simulated the behavior of the system, and the results show that using our coordination mechanism the waste water treatment plant can successfully treat most of the discharges, while the production activity of the industries is almost not affected by it.},

  abstract  = {It is a well-acknowledged fact that collaboration between different members of a supplychain yields a significant potential to increase overall supplychain performance. Sharing private information has been identified as prerequisite for collaboration and, at the same time, as one of its major obstacles. One potential avenue for overcoming this obstacle is Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC). SMC is a cryptographic technique that enables the computation of any (well-defined) mathematical function by a number of parties without any party having to disclose its input to another party. In this paper, we show how SMC can be successfully employed to enable joint decision-making and benefit sharing in a simple supplychain setting. We develop secure protocols for implementing the well-known {\textquotedblleft}Joint Economic Lot Size (JELS) Model{\textquotedblright} with benefit sharing in such a way that none of the parties involved has to disclose any private (cost and capacity) data. Thereupon, we show that although computation of the model{\textquoteright}s outputs can be performed securely, the approach still faces practical limitations. These limitations are caused by the potential of {\textquotedblleft}inverseoptimization{\textquotedblright}, i.e., a party can infer another party{\textquoteright}s private data from the output of a collaborativeplanning scheme even if the computation is performed in a secure fashion. We provide a detailed analysis of {\textquotedblleft}inverseoptimization{\textquotedblright} potentials and introduce the notion of {\textquotedblleft}stochastic security{\textquotedblright}, a novel approach to assess the additional information a party may learn from joint computation and benefit sharing. Based on our definition of {\textquotedblleft}stochastic security{\textquotedblright} we propose a stochastic benefit sharing rule, develop a secure protocol for this benefit sharing rule, and assess under which conditions stochastic benefit sharing can guarantee secure collaboration.},

As we do not put any constraints on the underlying social network, our framework is generally applicable and, in particular, constitutes an ideal plug-in for decentralized social networks.

In this paper, we embrace the social aspects of the Web 2.0 by considering a novel problem. We build a distributed social market that combines interest-based social networks with explicit networks like Facebook. Our Social Market (SM) allows users to identify and build connections to other users that can provide interesting goods, or information. At the same time, it backs up these connections with trust, by associating them with paths of trusted users that connect new acquaintances through the explicit network. This convergence of implicit and explicit networks yields TAPS, a novel gossip protocol that can be applied in applications devoted to commercial transactions, or to add robustness to standard gossip applications like dissemination or recommendation systems.},

To provide efficient service to users, these anonymity systems make full use of forwarding capacity when sending traffic between intermediate relays. In this paper, we show that doing this leaks information about the set of Tor relays in a circuit (path). We present attacks that, with high confidence and based solely on throughput information, can (a) reduce the attacker{\textquoteright}s uncertainty about the bottleneck relay of any Tor circuit whose throughput can be observed, (b) exactly identify the guard relay(s) of a Tor user when circuit throughput can be observed over multiple connections, and (c) identify whether two concurrent TCP connections belong to the same Tor user, breaking unlinkability. Our attacks are stealthy, and cannot be readily detected by a user or by Tor relays. We validate our attacks using experiments over the live Tor network. We find that the attacker can substantially reduce the entropy of a bottleneck relay distribution of a Tor circuit whose throughput can be observed{\textemdash}the entropy gets
reduced by a factor of 2 in the median case.
Such information leaks from a single Tor circuit can be combined over multiple connections to exactly identify a user{\textquoteright}s guard relay(s). Finally, we are also able to link two connections from the same initiator with a crossover error rate of less
than 1.5\% in under 5 minutes. Our attacks are also more accurate and require fewer resources than previous attacks on Tor.

  abstract  = {Flow watermarks are active traffic analysis techniques that help establish a causal connection between two network flows by content-independent manipulations, e.g., altering packet timings. Watermarks provide a much more
scalable approach for flow correlation than passive traffic analysis. Previous designs of scalable watermarks, however, were subject to multi-flow attacks. They also introduced delays too large to be used in most environments. We design SWIRL, a Scalable Watermark that is Invisible and Resilient to packet Losses. SWIRL is the first watermark that is practical to use for large-scale traffic analysis. SWIRL uses a flow-dependent approach to resist multi-flow
attacks, marking each flow with a different pattern. SWIRL is robust to packet losses and network jitter, yet it introduces only small delays that are invisible to both benign users and determined adversaries. We analyze the performance of SWIRL both analytically and on the PlanetLab testbed, demonstrating very low error rates. We consider applications of SWIRL to stepping stone detection and linking anonymous communication. We also propose a novel application of watermarks to defend against congestion attacks on Tor.

Rather than attempting to win the cat-and-mouse game of finding open proxies, we leverage censors{\textquoteright} unwillingness to completely block day-to-day Internet access. In effect, Telex converts innocuous, unblocked websites into proxies, without their explicit collaboration. We envision that friendly ISPs would deploy Telex stations on paths between censors{\textquoteright} networks and popular, uncensored Internet destinations. Telex stations would monitor seemingly innocuous flows for a special {\textquotedblleft}tag{\textquotedblright} and transparently divert them to a forbidden website or service instead. We propose a new cryptographic scheme based on elliptic curves for tagging TLS handshakes such that the tag is visible to a Telex
station but not to a censor. In addition, we use our tagging scheme to build a protocol that allows clients to connect to Telex stations while resisting both passive and active attacks. We also present a proof-of-concept implementation that demonstrates the feasibility of our system.

We focus on anonymous communication, and in particular onion routing, although we expect the approach to apply more broadly. This paper provides two main contributions. First, we present a novel model to consider the various security concerns for route selection in anonymity networks when users vary their trust over parts of the network. Second, to show the usefulness of our model, we present as an example a new algorithm to select paths in onion routing. We analyze its effectiveness against deanonymization and other information leaks, and particularly how it fares in our model versus existing algorithms, which do not consider trust. In contrast to those, we find that our trust-based routing strategy can protect anonymity against an adversary capable of attacking a significant fraction of the network.

Researchers have long known about the existence of Sybil accounts in online communities such as file-sharing systems, but have not been able to perform large scale measurements to detect them or measure their activities. In this paper, we describe our efforts to detect, characterize and understand Sybil account activity in the Renren online social network (OSN). We use ground truth provided by Renren Inc. to build measurement based Sybil account detectors, and deploy them on Renren to detect over 100,000 Sybil accounts. We study these Sybil accounts, as well as an additional 560,000 Sybil accounts caught by Renren, and analyze their link creation behavior. Most interestingly, we find that contrary to prior conjecture, Sybil accounts in OSNs do not form tight-knit communities. Instead, they integrate into the social graph just like normal users. Using link creation timestamps, we verify that the large majority of links between Sybil accounts are created accidentally, unbeknownst to the attacker. Overall, only a very small portion of Sybil accounts are connected to other Sybils with social links. Our study shows that existing Sybil defenses are unlikely to succeed in today{\textquoteright}s OSNs, and we must design new techniques to effectively detect and defend against Sybil attacks.},

  abstract     = {Low-latency anonymization networks such as Tor and JAP claim to hide the recipient and the content of communications from a local observer, i.e., an entity that can eavesdrop the traffic between the user and the first anonymization node. Especially users in totalitarian regimes strongly depend on such networks to freely communicate. For these people, anonymity is particularly important and an analysis of the anonymization methods against various attacks is necessary to ensure adequate protection. In this paper we show that anonymity in Tor and JAP is not as strong as expected so far and cannot resist website fingerprinting attacks under certain circumstances. We first define features for website
fingerprinting solely based on volume, time, and direction of the traffic. As a result, the subsequent classification becomes much easier. We apply support vector machines with the introduced features. We are able to improve recognition
results of existing works on a given state-of-the-art dataset in Tor from 3\% to 55\% and in JAP from 20\% to 80\%. The datasets assume a closed-world with 775 websites only. In a next step, we transfer our findings to a more complex and realistic open-world scenario, i.e., recognition of several websites in a set of thousands of random unknown websites. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first successful attack in the open-world scenario. We achieve a surprisingly high true positive rate of up to 73\% for a false positive rate of 0.05\%. Finally, we show preliminary results of a proof-of-concept implementation that applies camouflage as a countermeasure to hamper the fingerprinting attack. For
JAP, the detection rate decreases from 80\% to 4\% and for Tor it drops from 55\% to about 3\%.

  abstract  = {Distributed hash tables suffer from several security and privacy vulnerabilities, including the problem of Sybil attacks. Existing social network-based solutions to mitigate the Sybil attacks in DHT routing have a high state requirement and do not provide an adequate level of privacy. For instance, such techniques require a user to reveal their social network contacts. We design X-Vine, a protection mechanism for distributed hash tables that operates entirely by communicating over social network links. As with traditional peer-to-peer systems, X-Vine provides robustness, scalability, and a platform for innovation. The use of social network links for communication helps protect participant privacy and adds a new dimension of trust absent from previous designs. X-Vine is resilient to denial of service via Sybil attacks, and in fact is the first Sybil defense that requires only a logarithmic amount of state per node, making it suitable for large-scale and dynamic settings. X-Vine also helps protect the privacy of users social network contacts and keeps their IP addresses hidden from those outside of their social circle, providing a basis for pseudonymous communication. We first evaluate our design with analysis and simulations, using several real world large-scale social networking topologies. We show that the constraints of X-Vine allow the insertion of only a logarithmic number of Sybil identities per attack edge; we show this mitigates the impact of malicious attacks while not affecting the performance of honest nodes. Moreover, our algorithms are efficient, maintain low stretch, and avoid hot spots in the network. We validate our design with a PlanetLab implementation and a Facebook plugin.},

With its expressive language to describe event relations, it is suitable for environments where neither the event space nor the situations of interest are predefined but are constantly adapted.

While replacing replicated data consists in a simple copy, it becomes a complex operation with erasure codes: new data are produced performing a coding over some other available data. The amount of data to be read and coded is d times larger than the amount of data produced, where d, called repair degree, is larger than 1 and depends on the structure of the code. This implies that coding has a larger computational and I/O cost, which, for distributed storage systems, translates into increased network traffic. Participants of Peer-to-Peer systems often have ample storage and CPU power, but their network bandwidth may be limited. For these reasons existing coding techniques are not suitable for P2P storage. This work explores the design space between replication and the existing erasure codes. We propose and evaluate a new class of erasure codes, called Hierarchical Codes, which allows to reduce the network traffic due to maintenance without losing the benefits given by traditional erasure codes.},

cause of the social influence and correlation among friends. However, there are large variations in people{\textquoteright}s contribution of social content. Therefore, it is impractical to accurately model interests for all users. As a result, applications need to decide whether to utilize a user interest model based on its
accuracy. To address this challenge, we present a study on the accuracy of user interests inferred from three types of social content: social bookmarking, file sharing, and electronic communication, in an organizational social network within a large-scale enterprise. First, we demonstrate that combining different types of social content to infer user interests
outperforms methods that use only one type of social content. Second, we present a technique to predict the inference accuracy based on easily observed network characteristics, including user activeness, network in-degree, out-degree, and betweenness centrality.},

  abstract  = {Low-latency anonymity systems such as Tor, AN.ON, Crowds, and Anonymizer.com aim to provide anonymous connections that are both untraceable by "local" adversaries who control only a few machines, and have low enough delay to support anonymous use of network services like web browsing and remote login. One consequence of these goals is that these services leak some information about the network latency between the sender and one or more nodes in the system. This paper reports on three experiments that partially measure the extent to which such leakage can compromise anonymity. First, using a public dataset of pairwise round-trip times (RTTs) between 2000 Internet hosts, we estimate that on average, knowing the network location of host A and the RTT to host B leaks 3.64 bits of information about the network location of B. Second, we describe an attack that allows a pair of colluding web sites to predict, based on local timing information and with no additional resources, whether two connections from the same Tor exit node are using the same circuit with 17\% equal error rate. Finally, we describe an attack that allows a malicious website, with access to a network coordinate system and one corrupted Tor router, to recover roughly 6.8 bits of network location per hour.},

  abstract  = {A well known problem in peer-to-peer overlays is that no single entity has control over the software, hardware and configuration of peers. Thus, each peer can selfishly adapt its behaviour to maximise its benefit from the overlay. This thesis is concerned with the modelling and design of incentive mechanisms for QoS-overlays: resource allocation protocols that provide strategic peers with participation incentives, while at the same time optimising the performance of the peer-to-peer distribution overlay. The contributions of this thesis are as follows. First, we present PledgeRoute, a novel contribution accounting system that can be used, along with a set of reciprocity policies, as an incentive mechanism to encourage peers to contribute resources even when users are not actively consuming overlay services. This mechanism uses a decentralised credit network, is resilient to sybil attacks, and allows peers to achieve time and space deferred contribution reciprocity. Then, we present a novel, QoS-aware resource allocation model based on Vickrey auctions that uses PledgeRoute as a substrate. It acts as an incentive mechanism by providing efficient overlay construction, while at the same time allocating increasing service quality to those peers that contribute more to the network. The model is then applied to lagsensitive chunk swarming, and some of its properties are explored for different peer delay distributions. When considering QoS overlays deployed over the best-effort Internet, the quality received by a client cannot be adjudicated completely to either its serving peer or the intervening network between them. By drawing parallels between this situation and well-known hidden action situations in microeconomics, we propose a novel scheme to ensure adherence to advertised QoS levels. We then apply it to delay-sensitive chunk distribution overlays and present the optimal contract payments required, along with a method for QoS contract enforcement through reciprocative strategies. We also present a probabilistic model for application-layer delay as a function of the prevailing network conditions. Finally, we address the incentives of managed overlays, and the prediction of their behaviour. We propose two novel models of multihoming managed overlay incentives in which overlays can freely allocate their traffic flows between different ISPs. One is obtained by optimising an overlay utility function with desired properties, while the other is designed for data-driven least-squares fitting of the cross elasticity of demand. This last model is then used to solve for ISP profit maximisation.},

It is likely that its user base will continue to grow in numbers over the next few years as, unlike the eDonkey network, it does not depend on central servers, which increases scalability and reliability. Moreover, the Kad network is more efficient than unstructured systems such as Gnutella. However, we show that today{\textquoteright}s Kad network can be attacked in several ways by carrying out several (well-known) attacks on the Kad network. The presented attacks could be used either to hamper the correct functioning of the network itself, to censor contents, or to harm other entities in the Internet not participating in the Kad network such as ordinary web servers. While there are simple heuristics to reduce the impact of some of the attacks, we believe that the presented attacks cannot be thwarted easily in any fully decentralized peer-to-peer system without some kind of a centralized certification and verification authority.},

  abstract     = {Private matching between datasets owned by distinct parties is a challenging problem with several applications. Private matching allows two parties to identify the records that are close to each other according to some distance functions, such that no additional information other than the join result is disclosed to any party. Private matching can be solved securely and accurately using secure multi-party computation (SMC) techniques, but such an approach is prohibitively expensive in practice. Previous work proposed the release of sanitized versions of the sensitive datasets which allows blocking, i.e., filtering out sub-sets of records that cannot be part of the join result. This way, SMC is applied only to a small fraction of record pairs, reducing the matching cost to acceptable levels. The blocking step is essential for the privacy, accuracy and efficiency of matching. However, the state-of-the-art focuses on sanitization based on k-anonymity, which does not provide sufficient privacy. We propose an alternative design centered on differential privacy, a novel paradigm that provides strong privacy guarantees. The realization of the new model presents difficult challenges, such as the evaluation of distance-based matching conditions with the help of only a statistical queries interface. Specialized versions of data indexing structures (e.g., kd-trees) also need to be devised, in order to comply with differential privacy. Experiments conducted on the real-world Census-income dataset show that, although our methods provide strong privacy, their effectiveness in reducing matching cost is not far from that of k-anonymity based counterparts.},

Authentication of publishers and subscribers is difficult to achieve due to the loose coupling of publishers and subscribers. Similarly, confidentiality of events and subscriptions conflicts with content-based routing. In particular, content-based approaches in broker-less environments do not address confidentiality at all. This paper presents a novel approach to provide confidentiality and authentication in a broker-less content-based publish-subscribe system. The authentication of publishers and subscribers as well as confidentiality of events is ensured, by adapting the pairing-based cryptography mechanisms, to the needs of a publish/subscribe system. Furthermore, an algorithm to cluster subscribers according to their subscriptions preserves a weak notion of subscription confidentiality. Our approach provides fine grained key management and the cost for encryption, decryption and routing is in the order of subscribed attributes. Moreover, the simulation results verify that supporting security is affordable with respect to the cost for overlay construction and event dissemination latencies, thus preserving scalability of the system.},

Although MPC has been studied substantially, building solutions that are practical in terms of computation and communication cost is still a major challenge. In this paper, we investigate the practical usefulness of MPC for multi-domain network security and monitoring. We first optimize MPC comparison operations for processing high volume data in near real-time. We then design privacy-preserving protocols for event correlation and aggregation of network traffic statistics, such as addition of volume metrics, computation of feature entropy, and distinct item count. Optimizing performance of parallel invocations, we implement our protocols along with a complete set of basic operations in a library called SEPIA. We evaluate the running time and bandwidth requirements of our protocols in realistic settings on a local cluster as well as on PlanetLab and show that they work in near real-time for up to 140 input providers and 9 computation nodes. Compared to implementations using existing general-purpose MPC frameworks, our protocols are significantly faster, requiring, for example, 3 minutes for a task that takes 2 days with general-purpose frameworks. This improvement paves the way for new applications of MPC in the area of networking. Finally, we run SEPIA{\textquoteright}s protocols on real traffic traces of 17 networks and show how they provide new possibilities for distributed troubleshooting and early anomaly detection.},

Many researchers have since proposed ALM protocols, and have shown that these protocols only put a small burden on the network in terms of link-stress and -stretch. However, since the network is typically not a bottleneck, user acceptance remains the limiting factor for the deployment of ALM. In this paper we present an in-depth study of the user-perceived performance of the NICE ALM protocol. We use the OverSim simulation framework to evaluate delay experienced by a user and bandwidth consumption on the user{\textquoteright}s access link in large multicast groups and under aggressive churn models. Our major results are (1) latencies grow moderate with increasing number of nodes as clusters get optimized, (2) join delays get optimized over time, and (3) despite being a tree-dissemination protocol NICE handles churn surprisingly well when adjusting heartbeat intervals accordingly. We conclude that NICE comes up to the user{\textquoteright}s expectations even for large groups and under high churn.

  abstract     = {Tor is an anonymous communications network with thousands of router nodes worldwide. An intuition reflected in much of the literature on anonymous communications is that, as an anonymity network grows, it becomes more secure against a given observer because the observer will see less of the network. In particular, as the Tor network grows from volunteers operating relays all over the world, it becomes less and less likely for a single autonomous system (AS) to be able to observe both ends of an anonymous connection. Yet, as the network continues to grow significantly, no analysis has been done to determine if this intuition is correct. Further, modifications to Tor{\textquoteright}s path selection algorithm to help clients avoid an AS-level observer have not been proposed and analyzed.

Five years ago a previous study examined the AS-level threat against client and destination addresses chosen a priori to be likely or interesting to examine. Using an AS-level path inference algorithm with improved accuracy, more extensive Internet routing data, and, most importantly, a model of typical Tor client AS-level sources and destinations based on data gathered from the live network, we demonstrate that the threat of a single AS observing both ends of an anonymous Tor connection is greater than previously thought. We look at the growth of the Tor network over the past five years and show that its explosive growth has had only a small impact on the network{\textquoteright}s robustness against an AS-level attacker. Finally, we propose and evaluate the effectiveness of some simple, AS-aware path selection algorithms that avoid the computational overhead imposed by full AS-level path inference algorithms. Our results indicate that a novel heuristic we propose is more effective against an AS-level observer than other commonly proposed heuristics for improving location diversity in path selection.},

In this paper, we focus on ABE that supports revocation. Currently, there are two available revocable ABE schemes in the literature. Their revocation mechanisms, however, differ in the sense that they can be considered as direct and indirect methods. <em>Direct revocation</em> enforces revocation directly by the sender who specifies the revocation list while encrypting. <em>Indirect revocation</em> enforces revocation by the key authority who releases a key update material periodically in such a way that only non-revoked users can update their keys (hence, revoked users{\textquoteright} keys are implicitly rendered useless). An advantage of the indirect method over the direct one is that it does not require senders to know the revocation list. In contrast, an advantage of the direct method over the other is that it does not involve key update phase for all non-revoked users interacting with the key authority. In this paper, we present the first <em>Hybrid Revocable ABE</em> scheme that allows senders to select on-the-fly when encrypting whether to use either direct or indirect revocation mode; therefore, it combines best advantages from both methods.},

Such devices, e.g. mobile phones or sensor nodes, are exposed to human mobility and can therewith leverage inter-human contacts for store-and-forward routing. Efficiently routing in such delay tolerant networks is complex due to incomplete knowledge about the network, and high dynamics of the network. In this work we want to develop an extension of Bloom filters for resource-efficient routing in pocket switched networks. Furthermore, we argue that PSNs may become densely populated in special situations. We want to exploit such situations to perform collaborative calculations of forwarding-decisions. In this paper we present a simple scheme for distributed decision calculation using overlays and a DHT-based distributed variant of Bloom filters.},

Little attention is paid to the process of setting up and joining a peer-to-peer overlay network, i.e. the bootstrapping of peer-to-peer networks. The major challenge is to get hold of one peer that is already in the overlay. Otherwise, the first peer must be able to detect that the overlay is currently empty. Successful P2P applications either provide a centralized server for this task (Skype) or they simply put the burden on the user (eMule). We propose an automatic solution which does not require any user intervention and does not exhibit a single point of failure. Such decentralized bootstrapping protocols are especially important for open non-commercial peer-to-peer systems which cannot provide a server infrastructure for bootstrapping. The algorithm we are proposing builds on the Internet Relay Chat (IRC), a highly available, open,and distributed network of chat servers. Our algorithm is designed to put only a very minimal load on the IRC servers.In measurements we show that our bootstrapping protocol scales very well, handles flash crowds, and does only put a constant load on the IRC system disregarding of the peer-to-peer overlay size.},

  abstract  = {Private scalar product protocols have proved to be interesting in various applications such as data mining, data integration, trust computing, etc. In 2007, Yao et al. proposed a distributed scalar product protocol with application to privacy-preserving computation of trust [1]. This protocol is split in two phases: an homorphic encryption computation; and a private multi-party summation protocol. The summation protocol has two drawbacks: first, it generates a non-negligible communication overhead; and second, it introduces a security flaw. The contribution of this present paper is two-fold. We first prove that the protocol of [1] is not secure in the semi-honest model by showing that it is not resistant to collusion attacks and we give an example of a collusion attack, with only four participants. Second, we propose to use a superposed sending round as an alternative to the multi-party summation protocol, which results in better security properties and in a reduction of the communication costs. In particular, regarding security, we show that the previous scheme was vulnerable to collusions of three users whereas in our proposal we can t isin [1..n - 1] and define a protocol resisting to collusions of up to t users.},

This important problem is not solved by merely deleting meta-data, as there are scenarios in which all file contents must be deleted, e.g., due to a court order. Complete file deletion in a realistic peer-to-peer storage system has not been previously dealt with due to the intricacy of the problem - the system may experience high churn rates, nodes may crash or have intermittent connectivity, and the overlay network may become partitioned at times. We present an algorithm that eventually deletes all file contents, data and meta-data, in the aforementioned complex scenarios.

Specifically, we consider the Netflix Prize data set, and its leading algorithms, adapted to the framework of differential privacy.

Unlike prior privacy work concerned with cryptographically securing the computation of recommendations, differential privacy constrains a computation in a way that precludes any inference about the underlying records from its output. Such algorithms necessarily introduce uncertainty--i.e., noise--to computations, trading accuracy for privacy.

We find that several of the leading approaches in the Netflix Prize competition can be adapted to provide differential privacy, without significantly degrading their accuracy. To adapt these algorithms, we explicitly factor them into two parts, an aggregation/learning phase that can be performed with differential privacy guarantees, and an individual recommendation phase that uses the learned correlations and an individual{\textquoteright}s data to provide personalized recommendations. The adaptations are non-trivial, and involve both careful analysis of the per-record sensitivity of the algorithms to calibrate noise, as well as new post-processing steps to mitigate the impact of this noise.

We measure the empirical trade-off between accuracy and privacy in these adaptations, and find that we can provide non-trivial formal privacy guarantees while still outperforming the Cinematch baseline Netflix provides.},

  abstract     = {We examine peer-to-peer anonymous communication systems that use Distributed Hash Table algorithms for relay selection. We show that common design flaws in these schemes lead to highly effective attacks against the anonymity provided by the schemes. These attacks stem from attacks on DHT routing, and are not mitigated by the well-known DHT security mechanisms due to a fundamental mismatch between the security requirements of DHT routing{\textquoteright}s put/get functionality and anonymous routing{\textquoteright}s relay selection functionality. Our attacks essentially allow an adversary that controls only a small fraction of the relays to function as a global active adversary. We apply these attacks in more detail to two schemes: Salsa and Cashmere. In the case of Salsa, we show that an attacker that controls 10\% of the relays in a network of size 10,000 can compromise more than 80\% of all completed circuits; and in the case of Cashmere, we show that an attacker that controls 20\% of the relays in a network of size 64000 can compromise 42\% of the circuits.},

  abstract     = {Gossip-based information dissemination protocols are considered easy to deploy, scalable and resilient to network dynamics. Load-balancing is inherent in these protocols as the dissemination work is evenly spread among all nodes. Yet, large-scale distributed systems are usually heterogeneous with respect to network capabilities such as bandwidth. In practice, a blind load-balancing strategy might significantly hamper the performance of the gossip dissemination.

This paper presents HEAP, HEterogeneity-Aware gossip Protocol, where nodes dynamically adapt their contribution to the gossip dissemination according to their bandwidth capabilities. Using a continuous, itself gossip-based, approximation of relative bandwidth capabilities, HEAP dynamically leverages the most capable nodes by increasing their fanout, while decreasing by the same proportion that of less capable nodes. HEAP preserves the simple and proactive (churn adaptation) nature of gossip, while significantly improving its effectiveness. We extensively evaluate HEAP in the context of a video streaming application on a testbed of 270 PlanetLab nodes. Our results show that HEAP significantly improves the quality of the streaming over standard homogeneous gossip protocols, especially when the stream rate is close to the average available bandwidth.},

  abstract  = {Distributed hash tables (DHTs) have been actively studied in literature and many different proposals have been made on how to organize peers in a DHT. However, very few DHTs have been implemented in real systems and deployed on a large scale. One exception is KAD, a DHT based on Kademlia, which is part of eDonkey, a peer-to-peer file sharing system with several million simultaneous users. We have been crawling a representative subset of KAD every five minutes for six months and obtained information about geographical distribution of peers, session times, daily usage, and peer lifetime. We have found that session times are Weibull distributed and we show how this information can be exploited to make the publishing mechanism much more efficient. Peers are identified by the so-called KAD ID, which up to now was assumed to be persistent. However, we observed that a fraction of peers changes their KAD ID as frequently as once a session. This change of KAD IDs makes it difficult to characterize end-user behavior. For this reason we have been crawling the entire KAD network once a day for more than a year to track end-users with static IP addresses, which allows us to estimate end-user lifetime and the fraction of end-users changing their KAD ID.},

Now that energy efficiency requirements have stopped that trend, the number of processing cores per machine started to rise. In near future, these cores will become more specialized, and their inter-connections will form complex networks, both on-chip and beyond. This trend opens new fields of applications for high performance computing: Heterogeneous architectures offer different functionalities and thus support a wider range of applications. The increased compute power of these systems allows more complex simulations and numerical computations. Falling costs enable even small companies to invest in multi-core systems and clusters. However, the growing complexity might impede this growth. Imagine a cluster of thousands of interconnected heterogeneous processor cores. A software developer will need a deep knowledge about the underlying infrastructure as well as the data and communication dependencies in her application to partition it optimally across the available cores. Moreover, a predetermined partitioning scheme cannot reflect failing processors or additionally provided resources. In our poster, we introduce J-Cell, a project that aims at simplifying high performance distributed computing. J-Cell offers a single system image, which allows applications to run transparently on heterogeneous multi-core machines. It distributes code, objects and threads onto the compute resources which may be added or removed at run-time. This dynamic property leads to an ad-hoc network of processors and cores. In this network, a fully decentralized object localization and retrieval algorithm guarantees the access to distributed shared objects.},

Consequently, mechanisms have been designed that force the participants to behave more cooperatively. Most of these game-theoretic solutions rely on payments between participants. Unfortunately, such payments are often cumbersome to implement in practice, especially in dynamic networks and where transaction costs are high. In this paper, we investigate the potential of mechanisms which work without payments. We consider the problem of throughput maximization in multi-channel environments and shed light onto the throughput increase that can be achieved with and without payments. We introduce and analyze two different concepts: the worst-case leverage where we assume that players end up in the worst rational strategy profile, and the average-case leverage where player select a random non-dominated strategy. Our theoretical insights are complemented by simulations. },

  abstract  = {Modern board games present a new and challenging field when researching
search techniques in the field of Artificial Intelligence. These games differ to
classic board games, such as chess, in that they can be non-deterministic, have imperfect information or more than two players. While tree-search approaches, such as alpha-beta pruning, have been quite successful in playing classic board games, by for instance defeating the then reigning world champion Gary Kasparov in Chess, these techniques are not as effective when applied to modern board games.
This thesis investigates the effectiveness of Monte-Carlo Tree Search when applied to a modern board game, for which the board game Thurn and Taxis was used. This is a non-deterministic modern board game with imperfect information that can be played with more than 2 players, and is hence suitable for research. First, the state-space and game-tree complexities of this game are computed, from which the conclusion can be drawn that the two-player version of the game has a complexity similar to the game Shogi. Several techniques are investigated in order to improve the sampling process, for instance by adding domain knowledge.
Given the results of the experiments, one can conclude that Monte-Carlo Tree
Search gives a slight performance increase over standard Monte-Carlo search.
In addition, the most effective improvements appeared to be the application of
pseudo-random simulations and limiting simulation lengths, while other techniques have been shown to be less effective or even ineffective. Overall, when applying the best performing techniques, an AI with advanced playing strength has been created, such that further research is likely to push this performance to a strength of expert level.

Website administrators routinely rely on IP-address blocking for disabling access to misbehaving users, but blocking IP addresses is not practical if the abuser routes through an anonymizing network. As a result, administrators block {\em all} known exit nodes of anonymizing networks, denying anonymous access to honest and dishonest users alike.

A classical result by Cleve [STOC {\textquoteright}86] showed that for any two-party r-round coin-flipping protocol there exists an efficient adversary that can bias the output of the honest party by Ω(1/r). However, the best previously known protocol only guarantees O(1/√r) bias, and the question of whether Cleve{\textquoteright}s bound is tight has remained open for more than twenty years.
In this paper we establish the optimal trade-off between the round complexity and the bias of two-party coin-flipping protocols. Under standard assumptions (the existence of oblivious transfer), we show that Cleve{\textquoteright}s lower bound is tight: we construct an r-round protocol with bias O(1/r).},

Understanding the nature of traffic in high speed, high bandwidth communication system is essential for effective operation and performance evaluation of the networks. Many routing protocols reported in the literature for Mobile ad hoc networks(MANETS) have been primarily designed and analyzed under the assumption of CBR traffic models, which is unable to capture the statistical characteristics of the actual traffic. It is necessary to evaluate the performance properties of MANETs in the context of more realistic traffic models. In an effort towards this end, this paper evaluates the performance of adhoc on demand multipath distance vector (AOMDV) routing protocol in the presence of poisson and bursty self similar traffic and compares them with that of CBR traffic. Different metrics are considered in analyzing the performance of routing protocol including packet delivery ratio, throughput and end to end delay. Our simulation results indicate that the packet delivery fraction and throughput in AOMDV is increased in the presence of self similar traffic compared to other traffic. Moreover, it is observed that the end to end delay in the presence of self similar traffic is lesser than that of CBR and higher than that of poisson traffic.},

They could identify which relays were on a target Tor user{\textquoteright}s path by building paths one at a time through every Tor relay and introducing congestion. However, the original attack was performed on only 13 Tor relays on the nascent and lightly loaded Tor network.

We show that the attack from their paper is no longer practical on today{\textquoteright}s 1500-relay heavily loaded Tor network. The attack doesn{\textquoteright}t scale because a) the attacker needs a tremendous amount of bandwidth to measure enough relays during the attack window, and b) there are too many
false positives now that many other users are adding congestion at the same time as the attacks.

We then strengthen the original congestion attack by combining it with a novel bandwidth amplification attack based on a flaw in the Tor design that lets us build long circuits that loop back on themselves. We show that this new combination attack is practical and effective by demonstrating a working attack on today{\textquoteright}s deployed Tor network.

  abstract     = {In distributed storage systems, erasure codes represent an attractive solution to add redundancy to stored data while limiting the storage overhead. They are able to provide the same reliability as replication requiring much less storage space. Erasure coding breaks the data into pieces that are encoded and then stored on different nodes. However, when storage nodes permanently abandon the system, new redundant pieces must be created. For erasure codes, generating a new piece requires the transmission of k pieces over the network, resulting in a k times higher reconstruction traffic as compared to replication. Dimakis proposed a new class of codes, called Regenerating Codes, which are able to provide both the storage efficiency of erasure codes and the communication efficiency of replication. However, Dimakis gave only a theoretical description of the codes without discussing implementation issues or computational costs. We have done a real implementation of Random Linear Regenerating Codes that allows us to measure their computational cost, which can be significant if the parameters are not chosen properly. However, we also find that there exist parameter values that result in a significant reduction of the communication overhead at the expense of a small increase in storage cost and computation, which makes these codes very attractive for distributed storage systems.},

In this paper we show how probabilistic latency bounds can be applied in the context of publish/subscribe. We present an algorithm for maintaining individual probabilistic latency bounds in a highly dynamic environment for a large number of subscribers. The algorithm consists of an adaptive dissemination algorithm as well as a cluster partitioning scheme. Together they ensure i) adaptation to the individual latency requirements of subscribers under dynamically changing system properties, and ii) scalability by determining appropriate clusters according to available publishers in the system.},

Existing and future P2P live video systems will offer a large number of channels, with users switching frequently among the channels. In this paper, we develop infinite-server queueing network models to analytically study the performance of multi-channel P2P streaming systems. Our models capture essential aspects of multi-channel video systems, including peer channel switching, peer churn, peer bandwidth heterogeneity, and Zipf-like channel popularity. We apply the queueing network models to two P2P streaming designs: the isolated channel design (ISO) and the View-Upload Decoupling (VUD) design. For both of these designs, we develop efficient algorithms to calculate critical performance measures, develop an asymptotic theory to provide closed-form results when the number of peers approaches infinity, and derive near- optimal provisioning rules for assigning peers to groups in VUD. We use the analytical results to compare VUD with ISO. We show that VUD design generally performs significantly better, particularly for systems with heterogeneous channel popularities and streaming rates.},

We identify three key architectural shortcomings of the bridge design: (1) bridges are easy to find; (2) a bridge always accepts connections when its operator is using Tor; and (3) traffic to and from clients connected to a bridge interferes with traffic to and from the bridge operator. These shortcomings lead to an attack that can expose the IP address of bridge operators visiting certain web sites over Tor. We also discuss mitigation mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are about to become a popular and inexpensive tool for all kinds of applications. More advanced applications also need end-to-end routing, which goes beyond the simple data dissemination and collection mechanisms of early WSNs. The special properties of WSNs -- scarce memory, CPU, and energy resources -- make this a challenge. The Dynamic Address Routing protocol (DART) could be a good candidate for WSN routing, if it were not so prone to link outages.

In this paper, we propose Scalable Landmark Flooding (SLF), a new routing protocol for large WSNs. It combines ideas from landmark routing, flooding, and dynamic address routing. SLF is robust against link and node outages, requires only little routing state, and generates low maintenance traffic overhead.

  abstract     = {We introduce Torsk, a structured peer-to-peer low-latency anonymity protocol. Torsk is designed as an interoperable replacement for the relay selection and directory service of the popular Tor anonymity network, that decreases the bandwidth cost of relay selection and maintenance from quadratic to quasilinear while introducing no new attacks on the anonymity provided by Tor, and no additional delay to connections made via Tor. The resulting bandwidth savings make a modest-sized Torsk network significantly cheaper to operate, and allows low-bandwidth clients to join the network.

Unlike previous proposals for P2P anonymity schemes, Torsk does not require all users to relay traffic for others. Torsk utilizes a combination of two P2P lookup mechanisms with complementary strengths in order to avoid attacks on the confidentiality and integrity of lookups. We show by analysis that previously known attacks on P2P anonymity schemes do not apply to Torsk, and report on experiments conducted with a 336-node wide-area deployment of Torsk, demonstrating its efficiency and feasibility.

random walks over the structured topology while avoiding

We analytically calculate the anonymity provided by Sha-
dowWalker and show that it performs well for moderate lev-
els of attackers, and is much better than the state of the art.
We also design an extension that improves forwarding per-
formance at a slight anonymity cost, while at the same time
protecting against selective DoS attacks. We show that our
system has manageable overhead and can handle moderate
churn, making it an attractive new design for P2P anony-
mous communication.

We will first survey existing algorithms for centralised constraint satisfaction, and describe how they have been modified to handle distributed constraint satisfaction. The method by which each algorithm achieves completeness will be investigated and analysed by application of a new theorem.
We will then present a new algorithm, Support-Based Distributed Search, developed explicitly for distributed constraint satisfaction rather than being derived from centralised algorithms. This algorithm is inspired by the inherent structure of human arguments and similar mechanisms we observe in real-world negotiations.
A number of modifications to this new algorithm are considered, and comparisons are made with existing algorithms, effectively demonstrating its place within the field. Empirical analysis is then conducted, and comparisons are made to state-of-the-art algorithms most able to handle large distributed constraint satisfaction problems.
Finally, it is argued that any future development in distributed constraint satisfaction will necessitate changes in the algorithms used to solve small {\textquoteleft}embedded{\textquoteright} constraint satisfaction problems. The impact on embedded constraint satisfaction problems is considered, with a brief presentation of an improved algorithm for hypertree decomposition.},

In this paper we present SPINE, a content-based publish/subscribe system, which considers the particular challenges of deploying application-level services in Wireless Mesh Networks.

This mechanism allows peers to contribute resources to one set of peers and use this contribution to obtain services from a different set of peers, at a different time. PledgeRoute is completely decentralised, can be implemented in both structured and unstructured peer-to-peer systems, and it is resistant to the three kinds of attacks mentioned above.To achieve this, we model contribution transitivity as a routing problem in the contribution network of the peer-to-peer overlay, and we present arguments for the routing behaviour and the sybilproofness of our contribution transfer procedures on this basis. Additionally, we present mechanisms for the seeding of the contribution network, and a combination of incentive mechanisms and reciprocation policies that motivate peers to adhere to the protocol and maximise their service contributions to the overlay.},

  abstract     = {We study protocols to enable one user (the principal) to make potentially profitable but risky interactions with another user (the agent), in the absence of direct trust between the two parties. In such situations, it is possible to enable the interaction indirectly through a chain of credit or "trust" links. We introduce a model that provides insight into many disparate applications, including open currency systems, network trust aggregation systems, and manipulation-resistant recommender systems. Each party maintains a trust account for each other party. When a principal{\textquoteright}s trust balance for an agent is high enough to cover potential losses from a bad interaction, direct trust is sufficient to enable the interaction. Allowing indirect trust opens up more interaction opportunities, but also expands the strategy space of an attacker seeking to exploit the community for its own ends. We show that with indirect trust exchange protocols, some friction is unavoidable: any protocol that satisfies a natural strategic safety property that we call sum-sybilproofness can sometimes lead to a reduction in expected overall trust balances even on interactions that are profitable in expectation. Thus, for long-term growth of trust accounts, which are assets enabling risky but valuable interactions, it may be necessary to limit the use of indirect trust. We present the hedged-transitive protocol and show that it achieves the optimal rate of expected growth in trust accounts, among all protocols satisfying the sum-sybilproofness condition.},

  abstract  = {Any entity operating in cyberspace is susceptible to debilitating attacks. With cyber attacks intended to gather intelligence and disrupt communications rapidly replacing the threat of conventional and nuclear attacks, a new age of warfare is at hand. In 2003, the United States acknowledged that the speed and anonymity of cyber attacks makes distinguishing among the actions of terrorists, criminals, and nation states difficult. Even President Obama{\textquoteright}s Cybersecurity Chief-elect feels challenged by the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks. Indeed, the rising quantity and ubiquity of new surveillance technologies in cyberspace enables instant, undetectable, and unsolicited information collection about entities. Hence, anonymity and privacy are becoming increasingly important issues. Anonymization enables entities to protect their data and systems from a diverse set of cyber attacks and preserve privacy. This research provides a systematic analysis of anonymity degradation, preservation and elimination in cyberspace to enchance the security of information assets. This includes discovery/obfuscation of identities and actions of/from potential adversaries. First, novel taxonomies are developed for classifying and comparing the wide variety of well-established and state-of-the-art anonymous networking protocols. These expand the classical definition of anonymity and are the first known to capture the peer-to-peer and mobile ad hoc anonymous protocol family relationships. Second, a unique synthesis of state-of-the-art anonymity metrics is provided. This significantly aids an entities ability to reliably measure changing anonymity levels; thereby, increasing their ability to defend against cyber attacks. Finally, a novel epistemic-based model is created to characterize how an adversary reasons with knowledge to degrade anonymity.},

  abstract  = {The incremental adoption of IPv6, middle boxes (e.g., NATs, Firewalls) as well as completely new network types and protocols paint a picture of a future Internet that consists of extremely heterogeneous edge networks (e.g. IPv4, IPv6, industrial Ethernet, sensor networks) that are not supposed or able to communicate directly. This increasing heterogeneity imposes severe challenges for overlay networks, which are considered as a potential migration strategy towards the future Internet since they can add new functionality and services in a distributed and self-organizing manner. Unfortunately, overlays are based on end-to-end connectivity and, thus, their deployment is hindered by network heterogeneity. In this paper, we take steps towards a solution to enable overlay connections in such heterogeneous networks, building upon a model of heterogeneous networks that comprises several connectivity domains with direct connectivity, interconnected by relays. As major contribution, we present a distributed protocol that detects the boundaries of connectivity domains as well as relays using a gossiping approach. Furthermore, the protocol manages unique identifiers of connectivity domains and efficiently handles domain splitting and merging due to underlay changes. Simulation studies indicate that the algorithm can handle splitting and merging of connectivity domains in reasonable time and is scalable with respect to control overhead.},

Because a traffic engineer may be unaware of the structure of content distribution systems or overlay networks, this management of the network does not fully anticipate how traffic might change as a result of his actions. Content distribution systems that assign servers at the application level can respond very rapidly to changes in the routing of the network. Consequently, the traffic engineer{\textquoteright}s decisions may almost never be applied to the intended traffic. We use a game-theoretic framework in which infinitesimal users of a network select the source of content, and the traffic engineer decides how the traffic will route through the network. We formulate a game and prove the existence of equilibria. Additionally, we present a setting in which equilibria are socially optimal, essentially unique, and stable. Conditions under which efficiency loss may be bounded are presented, and the results are extended to the cases of general overlay networks and multiple autonomous systems.},

While there are some legitimate uses for encrypted traffic analysis, these techniques also raise important questions about the privacy of encrypted communications. A common tactic for
mitigating such threats is to pad packets to uniform sizes or to send packets at fixed timing intervals; however, this approach is often inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel method for thwarting statistical traffic analysis
algorithms by optimally morphing one class of traffic to look like another class. Through the use of convex optimization
techniques, we show how to optimally modify packets in real-time to reduce the accuracy of a variety of traffic classifiers while incurring much less overhead than padding. Our evaluation of this technique against two published traffic classifiers for VoIP [29] and web traffic [14] shows that morphing works well on a wide range of network data{\textemdash}in some cases, simultaneously providing better privacy and lower overhead than na{\textasciidieresis}{\i}ve defenses.},

Albeit there has been substantial research effort in this topic over the last years, the optimization of the various network coordinate algorithms has not been pursued systematically yet. Analyzing the well-known Vivaldi algorithm and its proposed optimizations with several sets of extensive Internet traffic traces, we found that in face of current Internet data most of the parameters that have been recommended in the original papers are a magnitude too high.

In this paper, we describe several improvements to the SSR protocol. They aim at providing nodes with more up-to-date routing information: 1. The use of link-layer broadcast enables all neighbors of a node to contribute to the forwarding process. 2. A light-weight and fast selection mechanism avoids packet duplication and optimizes the source route iteratively. 3. Nodes implicitly learn the network{\textquoteright}s topology from overheard broadcast messages.

We present simulation results which show the performance gain of the proposed improvements: 1. The delivery ratio in settings with high mobility increases. 2. The required per-node state can be reduced as compared with the original SSR protocol. 3. The route stretch decreases. --- These improvements are achieved without increasing the routing overhead.},

We present a novel method that applies common text mining techniques to the normalised frequency distribution of observable IP packet sizes. Our classifier correctly identifies up to 97\% of requests on a sample of 775 sites and over 300,000 real-world traffic dumps recorded over a two-month period. It outperforms previously known methods like Jaccard{\textquoteright}s classifier and Na{\"\i}ve Bayes that neglect packet frequencies altogether or rely on absolute frequency values, respectively. Our method is system-agnostic: it can be used against any PET without alteration. Closed-world results indicate that many popular single-hop and even multi-hop systems like Tor and JonDonym are vulnerable against this general fingerprinting attack. Furthermore, we discuss important real-world issues, namely false alarms and the influence of the browser cache on accuracy.},

Besides high demands in terms of graphical computation, games like Unreal also impose hard requirements regarding network packet delay and jitter, for small deterioration in these conditions influences gameplay recognizably. To make matters worse, such games generate a very specific network traffic with strong requirements in terms of data delivery. In this paper, we analyze the network traffic characteristics of Unreal Tournament 2004. The experiments include different aspects like variation of map sizes, player count, player behavior as well as hardware and game-specific configuration.

Distributed local search algorithms can be used for solving DisCOPs. However, because of the differences between the global evaluation of a system{\textquoteright}s state and the private evaluation of states by agents, agents are unaware of the global best state which is explored by the algorithm. Previous attempts to use local search algorithms for solving DisCOPs reported the state held by the system at the termination of the algorithm, which was not necessarily the best state explored.

A general framework for implementing distributed local search algorithms for DisCOPs is proposed. The proposed framework makes use of a BFS-tree in order to accumulate the costs of the system{\textquoteright}s state in its different steps and to propagate the detection of a new best step when it is found. The resulting framework enhances local search algorithms for DisCOPs with the anytime property. The proposed framework does not require additional network load. Agents are required to hold a small (linear) additional space (beside the requirements of the algorithm in use). The proposed framework preserves privacy at a higher level than complete DisCOP algorithms which make use of a pseudo-tree (ADOPT, DPOP).},

  abstract     = {This paper argues that ISP{\textquoteright}s recent actions to block certain applications (e.g. BitTorrent) and attempts to differentiate traffic could be a signal of bandwidth scarcity. Bandwidth-intensive applications such as VoD could have driven the traffic demand to the capacity limit of their networks. This paper proposes to let ISPs auction their bandwidth, instead of blocking or degrading applications. A user places a bid in a packet header based on how much he values the communication. When congestion occurs, ISPs allocate bandwidth to those users that value their packets the most, and charge them the Vickrey auction price. We outline a design that addresses the technical challenges to support this auction and analyze its feasibility. Our analysis suggests that the design have reasonable overhead and could be feasible with modern hardware.},

  abstract     = {Much recent work on Byzantine state machine replication focuses on protocols with improved performance under benign conditions (LANs, homogeneous replicas, limited crash faults), with relatively little evaluation under typical, practical conditions (WAN delays, packet loss, transient disconnection, shared resources). This makes it difficult for system designers to choose the appropriate protocol for a real target deployment. Moreover, most protocol implementations differ in their choice of runtime environment, crypto library, and transport, hindering direct protocol comparisons even under similar conditions.

We present a simulation environment for such protocols that combines a declarative networking system with a robust network simulator. Protocols can be rapidly implemented from pseudocode in the high-level declarative language of the former, while network conditions and (measured) costs of communication packages and crypto primitives can be plugged into the latter. We show that the resulting simulator faithfully predicts the performance of native protocol implementations, both as published and as measured in our local network.

We use the simulator to compare representative protocols under identical conditions and rapidly explore the effects of changes in the costs of crypto operations, workloads, network conditions and faults. For example, we show that Zyzzyva outperforms protocols like PBFT and Q/U undermost but not all conditions, indicating that one-size-fits-all protocols may be hard if not impossible to design in practice.},

BitBlender works by creating an ad-hoc multi-hop network consisting of special peers called "relay peers" that proxy requests and replies on behalf of other peers. To understand the effect of introducing relay peers into the BitTorrent system architecture, we provide an analysis of the expected path lengths as the ratio of relay peers to normal peers varies. A prototype is implemented and experiments are conducted on Planetlab to quantify the performance overhead associated with the protocol. We also propose protocol extensions to add confidentiality and access control mechanisms, countermeasures against traffic analysis attacks, and selective caching policies that simultaneously increase both anonymity and performance. We finally discuss the potential legal obstacles to deploying an anonymous file sharing protocol. This work is among the first to propose a privacy enhancing system that is designed specifically for a particular class of peer-to-peer traffic.},

  abstract  = {Incentives play a crucial role in BitTorrent, motivating users to upload to others to achieve fast download times for all peers. Though long believed to be robust to strategic manipulation, recent work has empirically shown that BitTorrent does not provide its users incentive to follow the protocol. We propose an auction-based model to study and improve upon BitTorrent{\textquoteright}s incentives. The insight behind our model is that BitTorrent uses, not tit-for-tat as widely believed, but an auction to decide which peers to serve. Our model not only captures known, performance-improving strategies, it shapes our thinking toward new, effective strategies. For example, our analysis demonstrates, counter-intuitively, that BitTorrent peers have incentive to intelligently under-report what pieces of the file they have to their neighbors. We implement and evaluate a modification to BitTorrent in which peers reward one another with proportional shares of bandwidth. Within our game-theoretic model, we prove that a proportional-share client is strategy-proof. With experiments on PlanetLab, a local cluster, and live downloads, we show that a proportional-share unchoker yields faster downloads against BitTorrent and BitTyrant clients, and that under-reporting pieces yields prolonged neighbor interest.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing systems have evolved to accommodate growing numbers of participating peers. In particular, new features have changed the properties of the unstructured overlay topologies formed by these peers. Little is known about the characteristics of these topologies and their dynamics in modern file-sharing applications, despite their importance. This paper presents a detailed characterization of P2P overlay topologies and their dynamics, focusing on the modern Gnutella network. We present Cruiser, a fast and accurate P2P crawler, which can capture a complete snapshot of the Gnutella network of more than one million peers in just a few minutes, and show how inaccuracy in snapshots can lead to erroneous conclusions--such as a power-law degree distribution. Leveraging recent overlay snapshots captured with Cruiser, we characterize the graph-related properties of individual overlay snapshots and overlay dynamics across slices of back-to-back snapshots. Our results reveal that while the Gnutella network has dramatically grown and changed in many ways, it still exhibits the clustering and short path lengths of a small world network. Furthermore, its overlay topology is highly resilient to random peer departure and even systematic attacks. More interestingly, overlay dynamics lead to an "onion-like" biased connectivity among peers where each peer is more likely connected to peers with higher uptime. Therefore, long-lived peers form a stable core that ensures reachability among peers despite overlay dynamics.

  abstract     = {We present a novel attack targeting anonymizing systems. The attack involves placing a malicious relay node inside an anonymizing system and keeping legitimate nodes "busy." We achieve this by creating circular circuits and injecting fraudulent packets, crafted in a way that will make them spin an arbitrary number of times inside our artificial loops. At the same time we inject a small number of malicious nodes that we control into the anonymizing system. By keeping a significant part of the anonymizing system busy spinning useless packets, we increase the probability of having our nodes selected in the creation of legitimate circuits, since we have more free capacity to route requests than the legitimate nodes. This technique may lead to the compromise of the anonymity of people using the system.

To evaluate our novel attack, we used a real-world anonymizing system, TOR. We show that an anonymizing system that is composed of a series of relay nodes which perform cryptographic operations is vulnerable to our packet spinning attack. Our evaluation focuses on determining the cost we can introduce to the legitimate nodes by injecting the fraudulent packets, and the time required for a malicious client to create n-length TOR circuits. Furthermore we prove that routers that are involved in packet spinning do not have the capacity to process requests for the creation of new circuits and thus users are forced to select our malicious nodes for routing their data streams.},

Either the files are tranfered via FTP, e-mail or similar medium before the access happens, or a centralized server provides file services. The first alternative has the disadvantage that the entire file has to be transfered before the first access can be successful. If only small parts in the file have been changed compared to a previous version, the entire file has to be transfered anyway. The centralized approach has disadvantages regarding scalability and reliability.

The covering traffic generated by our scheme uses the minimum sending rate to provide full anonymity for a given set of flows. The relationship between user anonymity and the minimum covering traffic rate is then studied via analysis and simulation. When user flows are Poisson processes with the same sending rate, the minimum covering traffic rate to provide full anonymity to m users is O(log m). For Pareto traffic, we show that the rate of the covering traffic converges to a constant when the number of flows goes to infinity. Finally, we use real Internet trace files to study the behavior of our algorithm when user flows have different rates.},

  abstract  = {Intermittently connected mobile networks are wireless networks where most of the time there does not exist a complete path from the source to the destination. There are many real networks that follow this model, for example, wildlife tracking sensor networks, military networks, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), etc. In this context, conventional routing schemes would fail, because they try to establish complete end-to-end paths, before any data is sent.

To deal with such networks researchers have suggested to use flooding-based routing schemes. While flooding-based schemes have a high probability of delivery, they waste a lot of energy and suffer from severe contention which can significantly degrade their performance. With this in mind, we look into a number of "single-copy" routing schemes that use only one copy per message, and hence significantly reduce the resource requirements of flooding-based algorithms. We perform a detailed exploration of the single-copy routing space in order to identify efficient single-copy solutions that (i) can be employed when low resource usage is critical, and (ii) can help improve the design of general routing schemes that use multiple copies. We also propose a theoretical framework that we use to analyze the performance of all single-copy schemes presented, and to derive upper and lower bounds on the delay of any scheme.},

  abstract  = {A foundational issue underlying many overlay network applications ranging from routing to peer-to-peer file sharing is that of connectivity management, i.e., folding new arrivals into an existing overlay, and re-wiring to cope with changing network conditions. Previous work has considered the problem from two perspectives: devising practical heuristics for specific applications designed to work well in real deployments, and providing abstractions for the underlying problem that are analytically tractable, especially via game-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we unify these two thrusts by using insights gleaned from novel, realistic theoretic models in the design of Egoist -- a distributed overlay routing system that we implemented, deployed, and evaluated on PlanetLab. Using extensive measurements of paths between nodes, we demonstrate that Egoist{\textquoteright}s neighbor selection primitives significantly outperform existing heuristics on a variety of performance metrics, including delay, available bandwidth, and node utilization. Moreover, we demonstrate that Egoist is competitive with an optimal, but unscalable full-mesh approach, remains highly effective under significant churn, is robust to cheating, and incurs minimal overhead. Finally, we use a multiplayer peer-to-peer game to demonstrate the value of Egoist to end-user applications.},

In the present work we compare three complete algorithms for DCOP, aiming at studying how they perform in complex and dynamic scenarios of increasing sizes. In order to assess their performance we measure not only standard quantities such as number of cycles to arrive to a solution, size and quantity of exchanged messages, but also computing time and quality of the solution which is related to the particular domain we use. This study can shed light in the issues of how the algorithms perform when applied to problems other than those reported in the literature (graph coloring, meeting scheduling, and distributed sensor network).},

  abstract     = {With the popularity of BitTorrent, improving its performance has been an active research area. Super-seeding, a special upload policy for initial seeds, improves the efficiency in producing multiple seeds and reduces the uploading cost of the initial seeders. However, the overall benefit of super seeding remains a question. In this paper, we conduct an experimental study over the performance of super-seeding scheme of BitTornado. We attempt to answer the following questions: whether and how much super-seeding saves uploading cost, whether the download time of all peers is decreased by super-seeding, and in which scenario super-seeding performs worse. With varying seed bandwidth and peer behavior, we analyze the overall download time and upload cost of super seeding scheme during random period tests over 250 widely distributed PlanetLab nodes. The results show that benefits of super-seeding depend highly on the upload bandwidth of the initial seeds and the behavior of individual peers. Our work not only provides reference for the potential adoption of super-seeding in BitTorrent, but also much insights for the balance of enhancing Quality of Experience (QoE) and saving cost for a large-scale BitTorrent-like P2P commercial application.},

  abstract     = {We present FairplayMP (for "Fairplay Multi-Party"), a system for secure multi-party computation. Secure computation is one of the great achievements of modern cryptography, enabling a set of untrusting parties to compute any function of their private inputs while revealing nothing but the result of the function. In a sense, FairplayMP lets the parties run a joint computation that emulates a trusted party which receives the inputs from the parties, computes the function, and privately informs the parties of their outputs. FairplayMP operates by receiving a high-level language description of a function and a configuration file describing the participating parties. The system compiles the function into a description as a Boolean circuit, and perform a distributed evaluation of the circuit while revealing nothing else. FairplayMP supplements the Fairplay system [16], which supported secure computation between two parties. The underlying protocol of FairplayMP is the Beaver-Micali-Rogaway (BMR) protocol which runs in a constant number of communication rounds (eight rounds in our implementation). We modified the BMR protocol in a novel way and considerably improved its performance by using the Ben-Or-Goldwasser-Wigderson (BGW) protocol for the purpose of constructing gate tables. We chose to use this protocol since we believe that the number of communication rounds is a major factor on the overall performance of the protocol. We conducted different experiments which measure the effect of different parameters on the performance of the system and demonstrate its scalability. (We can now tell, for example, that running a second-price auction between four bidders, using five computation players, takes about 8 seconds.)},

  abstract  = {Inter-ISP traffic flow determines the settlement between ISPs and affects the perceived performance of ISP services. In today{\textquoteright}s Internet, the inter-ISP traffic flow patterns are controlled not only by ISPs{\textquoteright} policy-based routing configuration and traffic engineering, but also by application layer routing. The goal of this paper is to study the economic implications of this shift in Internet traffic control assuming rational ISPs and subscribers. For this purpose, we build a general traffic model that predicts traffic patterns based on subscriber distribution and abstract traffic controls such as caching functions and performance sensitivity functions. We also build a game-theoretic model of subscribers picking ISPs, and ISPs making provisioning and peering decisions. In particular, we apply this to a local market where two ISPs compete for market share of subscribers under two traffic patterns: {\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}Web{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}P2P overlay{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}, that typifies the transition the current Internet is going through. Our methodology can be used to quantitatively demonstrate that (1) while economy of scale is the predominant property of the competitive ISP market, P2P traffic may introduce unfair distribution of peering benefit (i.e. free-riding); (2) the large ISP can restore more fairness by reducing its private capacity (bandwidth throttling), which has the drawback of hurting business growth; and (3) ISPs can reduce the level of peering (e.g. by reducing peering bandwidth) to restore more fairness, but this has the side-effect of also reducing the ISPs{\textquoteright} collective bargaining power towards subscribers.},

The senders using an IBE do not need to look up the public keys and the corresponding certificates of the receivers, the identities (e.g. emails or IP addresses) of the latter are sufficient to encrypt. Any setting, PKI- or identity-based, must provide a means to revoke users from the system. Efficient revocation is a well-studied problem in the traditional PKI setting. However in the setting of IBE, there has been little work on studying the revocation mechanisms. The most practical solution requires the senders to also use time periods when encrypting, and all the receivers (regardless of whether their keys have been compromised or not) to update their private keys regularly by contacting the trusted authority. We note that this solution does not scale well -- as the number of users increases, the work on key updates becomes a bottleneck. We propose an IBE scheme that significantly improves key-update efficiency on the side of the trusted party (from linear to logarithmic in the number of users), while staying efficient for the users. Our scheme builds on the ideas of the Fuzzy IBE primitive and binary tree data structure, and is provably secure.},

  abstract     = {The Tor anonymisation network allows services, such as web servers, to be operated under a pseudonym. In previous work Murdoch described a novel attack to reveal such hidden services by correlating clock skew changes with times of increased load, and hence temperature. Clock skew measurement suffers from two main sources of noise: network jitter and timestamp quantisation error. Depending on the target{\textquoteright}s clock frequency the quantisation noise can be orders of magnitude larger than the noise caused by typical network jitter. Quantisation noise limits the previous attacks to situations where a high frequency clock is available. It has been hypothesised that by synchronising measurements to the clock ticks, quantisation noise can be reduced. We show how such synchronisation can be achieved and maintained, despite network jitter. Our experiments show that synchronised sampling significantly reduces the quantisation error and the remaining noise only depends on the network jitter (but not clock frequency). Our improved skew estimates are up to two magnitudes more accurate for low-resolution timestamps and up to one magnitude more accurate for high-resolution timestamps, when compared to previous random sampling techniques. The improved accuracy not only allows previous attacks to be executed faster and with less network traffic but also opens the door to previously infeasible attacks on low-resolution clocks, including measuring skew of a HTTP server over the anonymous channel.

  abstract  = {The Tor network gives anonymity to Internet users by relaying their traffic through the world over a variety of routers. This incurs latency, and this thesis first explores where this latency occurs. Experiments discount the latency induced by routing
traffic and computational latency to determine there is a substantial component that is caused by delay in the communication path. We determine that congestion control is causing the delay.
Tor multiplexes multiple streams of data over a single TCP connection. This is not a wise use of TCP, and as such results in the unfair application of congestion control. We illustrate an example of this occurrence on a Tor node on the live network and also illustrate how packet dropping and reordering cause interference between the multiplexed streams.
Our solution is to use a TCP-over-DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) transport between routers, and give each stream of data its own TCP connection. We give our design for our proposal, and details about its implementation. Finally, we perform experiments on our implemented version to illustrate that our proposal has in fact resolved the multiplexing issues discovered in our system performance analysis. The future work gives a number of steps towards optimizing and improving our work, along with some tangential ideas that were discovered during research.
Additionally, the open-source software projects latency proxy and libspe, which were designed for our purposes but programmed for universal applicability, are discussed.},

We show that the techniques that are used to combat active attacks on the lookup mechanism dramatically increase information leaks and increase the efficacy of passive attacks. Thus there is a trade-off between robustness to active and passive attacks.

We study this trade-off in two P2P anonymous systems, Salsa and AP3. In both cases, we find that, by combining both passive and active attacks, anonymity can be compromised much more effectively than previously thought, rendering these systems insecure for most proposed uses. Our results hold even if security parameters are changed or other improvements to the systems are considered. Our study therefore motivates the search for new approaches to P2P anonymous communication.},

This paper compares two popular schemes: replication and erasure coding. Unlike previous comparison, we take user download behavior into account. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid redundancy scheme, which shares user downloaded files for subsequent accesses and utilizes erasure coding to adjust file availability. Comparison experiments of three schemes show that replication saves more bandwidth than erasure coding, although it requires more storage space, when average node availability is higher than 47\%; moreover, our hybrid scheme saves more maintenance bandwidth with acceptable redundancy factor.},

In this article we propose a generic framework for computation of similarity measures for sequences, covering various kernel, distance and non-metric similarity functions. The basis for comparison is embedding of sequences using a formal language, such as a set of natural words, k-grams or all contiguous subsequences. As realizations of the framework we provide linear-time algorithms of different complexity and capabilities using sorted arrays, tries and suffix trees as underlying data structures.

Experiments on data sets from bioinformatics, text processing and computer security illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms---enabling peak performances of up to 106 pairwise comparisons per second. The utility of distances and non-metric similarity measures for sequences as alternatives to string kernels is demonstrated in applications of text categorization, network intrusion detection and transcription site recognition in DNA.},

  abstract  = {Scalable source routing (SSR) is a self-organizing routing protocol which is especially suited for networks that do not have a well-crafted structure, e.g. ad hoc and mesh networks. SSR works on a flat identifier space. As a consequence, it can easily support host mobility without requiring any location directory or other centralized service. SSR is based on a virtual ring structure, which is used in a chord-like manner to obtain source routes to previously unknown destinations. It has been shown that SSR requires very little per node state and produces very little control messages. In particular, SSR has been found to outperform other ad hoc routing protocols such as ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing, optimized link-state routing, or beacon vector routing. In this paper we present Linyphi, an implementation of SSR for wireless access routers. Linyphi combines IPv6 and SSR so that unmodified IPv6 hosts have transparent connectivity to both the Linyphi mesh network and the IPv4-v6 Internet. We give a basic outline of the implementation and demonstrate its suitability in real-world mesh network scenarios. Furthermore, we illustrate the use of Linyphi for distributed applications such as the Linyphone peer-to-peer VoIP application. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This architecture makes services more vulnerable to internal attacks coming from compromised nodes that behave arbitrarily to disrupt the network, also referred to as Byzantine attacks. In this work, we examine the impact of several Byzantine attacks performed by individual or colluding attackers. We propose ODSBR, the first on-demand routing protocol for ad hoc wireless networks that provides resilience to Byzantine attacks caused by individual or colluding nodes. The protocol uses an adaptive probing technique that detects a malicious link after log n faults have occurred, where n is the length of the path. Problematic links are avoided by using a route discovery mechanism that relies on a new metric that captures adversarial behavior. Our protocol never partitions the network and bounds the amount of damage caused by attackers. We demonstrate through simulations ODSBR{\textquoteright}s effectiveness in mitigating Byzantine attacks. Our analysis of the impact of these attacks versus the adversary{\textquoteright}s effort gives insights into their relative strengths, their interaction, and their importance when designing multihop wireless routing protocols.},

  abstract     = {Mechanism design is now a standard tool in computer science for aligning the incentives of self-interested agents with the objectives of a system designer. There is, however, a fundamental disconnect between the traditional application domains of mechanism design (such as auctions) and those arising in computer science (such as networks): while monetary "transfers" (i.e., payments) are essential for most of the known positive results in mechanism design, they are undesirable or even technologically infeasible in many computer systems. Classical impossibility results imply that the reach of mechanisms without transfers is severely limited. Computer systems typically do have the ability to reduce service quality--routing systems can drop or delay traffic, scheduling protocols can delay the release of jobs, and computational payment schemes can require computational payments from users (e.g., in spam-fighting systems). Service degradation is tantamount to requiring that users "burn money", and such "payments" can be used to influence the preferences of the agents at a cost of degrading the social surplus. We develop a framework for the design and analysis of "money-burning mechanisms" to maximize the residual surplus-the total value of the chosen outcome minus the payments required. Our primary contributions are the following. * We define a general template for prior-free optimal mechanism design that explicitly connects Bayesian optimal mechanism design, the dominant paradigm in economics, with worst-case analysis. In particular, we establish a general and principled way to identify appropriate performance benchmarks in prior-free mechanism design. * For general single-parameter agent settings, we characterize the Bayesian optimal money-burning mechanism. * For multi-unit auctions, we design a near-optimal prior-free money-burning mechanism: for every valuation profile, its expected residual surplus is within a constant factor of our benchmark, the residual surplus of the best Bayesian optimal mechanism for this profile. * For multi-unit auctions, we quantify the benefit of general transfers over money-burning: optimal money-burning mechanisms always obtain a logarithmic fraction of the full social surplus, and this bound is tight.},

We conducted extensive simulations and real-life experiments on the Internet to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of P4P.

We believe that the main reason is not disbelief in their ability to protect anonymity, but rather the practical limitations in bandwidth and latency that stem from limited participation. This limited participation, in turn, is due to a lack of incentives to participate. We propose providing economic incentives, which historically have worked very well.
In this paper, we demonstrate a payment scheme that can be used to compensate nodes which provide anonymity in Tor, an existing onion routing, anonymizing network. We show that current anonymous payment schemes are not suitable and introduce a hybrid payment system based on a combination of the Peppercoin Micropayment system and a new type of {\textquotedblleft}one use{\textquotedblright} electronic cash.

Surprisingly, all previously published techniques require very specific user behavior to break the anonymity provided by mixes. At the same time, it is also well known that none of the considered user models reflects realistic behavior which casts some doubt on previous work with respect to real-life scenarios. We first present a user behavior model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the least restrictive scheme considered so far. Second, we develop the Perfect Matching Disclosure Attack, an efficient attack based on graph theory that operates without any assumption on user behavior. The attack is highly effective when de-anonymizing mixing rounds because it considers all users in a round at once, rather than single users iteratively. Furthermore, the extracted sender-receiver relationships can be used to enhance user profile estimations. We extensively study the effectiveness and efficiency of our attack and previous work when de-anonymizing users communicating through a threshold mix. Empirical results show the advantage of our proposal. We also show how the attack can be refined and adapted to different scenarios including pool mixes, and how precision can be traded in for speed, which might be desirable in certain cases. },

  abstract     = {Tor (The Onion Routing) provides a secure mechanism for offering TCP-based services while concealing the hidden server{\textquoteright}s IP address. In general the acceptance of services strongly relies on its QoS properties. For potential Tor users, provided the anonymity is secured, probably the most important QoS parameter is the time until they finally get response by such a hidden service. Internally, overall response times are constituted by several steps invisible for the user. We provide comprehensive measurements of all relevant latencies and a detailed statistical analysis with special focus on the overall response times. Thereby, we gain valuable insights that enable us to give certain statistical assertions and to suggest improvements in the hidden service protocol and its implementation.},

The number of nodes in an overlay fluctuates all the time due to churn. Since knowledge of the size of the overlay is a core requirement for many systems, estimating the size in a decentralized manner is a challenge taken up by recent research activities. Gossip-based Aggregation has been shown to give accurate estimates for the network size, but previous work done is highly sensitive to node failures. In this paper, we present a gossip-based aggregation-style network size estimation algorithm. We discuss shortcomings of existing aggregation-based size estimation algorithms, and give a solution that is highly robust to node failures and is adaptive to network delays. We examine our solution in various scenarios to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

Progressive unpruning first reduces the branching factor, and then increases it gradually again. Experiments assess that the two progressive strategies significantly improve the level of our Go program Mango. Moreover, we see that the combination of both strategies performs even better on larger board sizes.},

However, the broader the application area, the more important become performance issues for a KBR service. In this paper, we present a novel approach to provide a generic KBR service. Its key idea is to use a predictable address assignment scheme. This scheme allows peers to calculate the overlay address of the node that is responsible for a given key and application ID. A public DHT service such as OpenDHT can then resolve this overlay address to the transport address of the respective peer. We compare our solution to alternative proposals such as ReDiR and Diminished Chord. We conclude that our solution has a better worst case complexity for some important KBR operations and the required state. In particular, unlike ReDiR, our solution can guarantee a low latency for KBR route operations. },

Here we consider a more natural model, in which an AS is also interested in attracting incoming traffic (e.g., because other ASes pay it to carry their traffic). We ask what combinations of BGP enhancements and restrictions on routing policies can ensure that ASes have no incentive to lie about their data-plane paths. We find that protocols like S-BGP alone are insufficient, but that S-BGP does suffice if coupled with additional (quite unrealistic) restrictions on routing policies. Our game-theoretic analysis illustrates the high cost of ensuring that the ASes honestly announce data-plane paths in their BGP path announcements.},

To sample the results, we show that web traffic makes up the majority of the connections and bandwidth, but non-interactive protocols consume a disproportionately large amount of bandwidth when compared to interactive protocols. We provide a survey of how Tor is being misused, both by clients and by Tor router operators. In particular, we develop a method for detecting exit router logging (in certain cases). Finally, we present evidence that Tor is used throughout the world, but router participation is limited to only a few countries.},

However, routing in the presence of overlay irregularity is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel routing protocol, RASTER, that approximates shortest overlay routes between nodes in randomized DHTs. Unlike previously proposed routing protocols, RASTER encodes and aggregates routing information. Its simple bitmap-encoding scheme together with the proposed RASTER routing algorithm enable a performance edge over current overlay routing protocols. RASTER provides a forwarding overhead of merely a small constant number of bitwise operations, a routing performance close to optimal, and a better resilience to churn. RASTER also provides nodes with the flexibility to adjust the size of the maintained routing information based on their storage/processing capabilities. The cost of storing and exchanging encoded routing information is manageable and grows logarithmically with the number of nodes in the system.},

Using traces from a real large-scale system as well as analytical models, we show that, while the number of stable nodes is small throughout a whole session, their longer lifespans make them constitute a significant portion in a per-snapshot view of a peer-to-peer overlay. As a result, they have substantially affected the performance of the overall system. Inspired by this, we propose a tiered overlay design, with stable nodes being organized into a tier-1 backbone for serving tier-2 nodes. It offers a highly cost-effective and deployable alternative to proxy-assisted designs. We develop a comprehensive set of algorithms for stable node identification and organization. Specifically, we present a novel structure, Labeled Tree, for the tier-1 overlay, which, leveraging stable peers, simultaneously achieves low overhead and high transmission reliability. Our tiered framework flexibly accommodates diverse existing overlay structures in the second tier. Our extensive simulation results demonstrated that the customized optimization using selected stable nodes boosts the streaming quality and also effectively reduces the control overhead. This is further validated through prototype experiments over the PlanetLab network.},

  abstract  = {In an n-way broadcast application each one of n overlay nodes wants to push its own distinct large data file to all other n-1 destinations as well as download their respective data files. BitTorrent-like swarming protocols are ideal choices for handling such massive data volume transfers. The original BitTorrent targets one-to-many broadcasts of a single file to a very large number of receivers and thus, by necessity, employs an almost random overlay topology. n-way broadcast applications on the other hand, owing to their inherent n-squared nature, are realizable only in small to medium scale networks. In this paper, we show that we can leverage this scale constraint to construct optimized overlay topologies that take into consideration the end-to-end characteristics of the network and as a consequence deliver far superior performance compared to random and myopic (local) approaches. We present the Max-Min and Max- Sum peer-selection policies used by individual nodes to select their neighbors. The first one strives to maximize the available bandwidth to the slowest destination, while the second maximizes the aggregate output rate. We design a swarming protocol suitable for n-way broadcast and operate it on top of overlay graphs formed by nodes that employ Max-Min or Max-Sum policies. Using trace-driven simulation and measurements from a PlanetLab prototype implementation, we demonstrate that the performance of swarming on top of our constructed topologies is far superior to the performance of random and myopic overlays. Moreover, we show how to modify our swarming protocol to allow it to accommodate selfish nodes.},

Often, competing designs are judged by their respective performance in simulations. Despite this great importance the state-of-the-art in network simulations is nevertheless still low. A recent survey showed that most publications in a top conference did not even give enough details to repeat the simulations. In this paper we go beyond repeatability and ask: Are different simulations comparable? We study various implementations of the IEEE 802.11 media access layer in ns-2 and OMNeT++ and report some dramatic differences. These findings indicate that two protocols cannot be compared meaningfully unless they are compared in the very same simulation environment. We claim that this problem limits the value of the respective publications because readers are forced to re-implement the work that is described in the paper rather than building on its results. Facing the additional problem that not all authors will agree on one simulator, we address ways of making different simulators comparable.},

  abstract  = {Privacy is ultimately important, and there is a fair amount of research about it. However, few empirical studies about the cost of privacy are conducted. In the area of secure multiparty computation, the scalar product has long been reckoned as one of the most promising building blocks in place of the classic logic gates. The reason is not only the scalar product complete, which is as good as logic gates, but also the scalar product is much more efficient than logic gates. As a result, we set to study the computation and communication resources needed for some of the most well-known and frequently referred secure scalar-product protocols, including the composite-residuosity, the invertible-matrix, the polynomial-sharing, and the commodity-based approaches. Besides the implementation remarks of these approaches, we analyze and compare their execution time, computation time, and random number consumption, which are the most concerned resources when talking about secure protocols. Moreover, Fairplay the benchmark approach implementing Yao{\textquoteright}s famous circuit evaluation protocol, is included in our experiments in order to demonstrate the potential for the scalar product to replace logic gates.},

  abstract  = {Most current peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing systems treat their users as anonymous, unrelated entities, and completely disregard any social relationships between them. However, social phenomena such as friendship and the existence of communities of users with similar tastes or interests may well be exploited in such systems in order to increase their usability and performance. In this paper we present a novel social-based P2P file-sharing paradigm that exploits social phenomena by maintaining social networks and using these in content discovery, content recommendation, and downloading. Based on this paradigm{\textquoteright}s main concepts such as taste buddies and friends, we have designed and implemented the TRIBLER P2P file-sharing system as a set of extensions to BitTorrent. We present and discuss the design of TRIBLER, and we show evidence that TRIBLER enables fast content discovery and recommendation at a low additional overhead, and a significant improvement in download performance.

To address the case where domains do not have a secure channel between them, we extend our scheme with the concept of trust-rating.

  abstract     = {The Tor anonymous communication network uses selfreported bandwidth values to select routers for building tunnels. Since tunnels are allocated in proportion to this bandwidth, this allows a malicious router operator to attract tunnels for compromise. Since the metric used is insensitive to relative load, it does not adequately respond to changing conditions and hence produces unreliable performance, driving many users away. We propose an opportunistic bandwidth measurement algorithm to replace selfreported values and address both of these problems. We also propose a mechanisms to let users tune Tor performance to achieve higher performance or higher anonymity. Our mechanism effectively blends the traffic from users of different preferences, making partitioning attacks difficult. We implemented the opportunistic measurement and tunable performance extensions and examined their performance both analytically and in the real Tor network. Our results show that users can get dramatic increases in either performance or anonymity with little to no sacrifice in the other metric, or a more modest improvement in both. Our mechanisms are also invulnerable to the previously published low-resource attacks on Tor. },

  abstract  = {Next generation networks will combine many heterogeneous access technologies to provide services to a large number of highly mobile users while meeting their demands for quality of service, robustness, and security. Obviously, this is not a trivial task and many protocols fulfilling some combination of these requirements have been proposed. However, non of the current proposals meets all requirements, and the deployment of new applications and services is hindered by a patchwork of protocols. This paper presents Spontaneous Virtual Networks (SpoVNet), an architecture that fosters the creation of new applications and services for next generation networks by providing an underlay abstraction layer. This layer applies an overlay-based approach to cope with mobility, multi-homing, and heterogeneity. For coping with network mobility, it uses a SpoVNet-specific addressing scheme, splitting node identifiers from network locators and providing persistent connections by transparently switching locators. To deal with multihoming it transparently chooses the most appropriate pair of network locators for each connection. To cope with network and protocol heterogeneity, it uses dedicated overlay nodes, e.g., for relaying between IPv4 and IPv6 hosts},

  abstract  = {Learning problems form an important category of computational tasks that generalizes many of the computations researchers apply to large real-life data sets. We ask: what concept classes can be learned privately, namely, by an algorithm whose output does not depend too heavily on any one input or specific training example? More precisely, we investigate learning algorithms that satisfy differential privacy, a notion that provides strong confidentiality guarantees in contexts where aggregate information is released about a database containing sensitive information about individuals. We demonstrate that, ignoring computational constraints, it is possible to privately agnostically learn any concept class using a sample size approximately logarithmic in the cardinality of the concept class. Therefore, almost anything learnable is learnable privately: specifically, if a concept class is learnable by a (non-private) algorithm with polynomial sample complexity and output size, then it can be learned privately using a polynomial number of samples. We also present a computationally efficient private PAC learner for the class of parity functions. Local (or randomized response) algorithms are a practical class of private algorithms that have received extensive investigation. We provide a precise characterization of local private learning algorithms. We show that a concept class is learnable by a local algorithm if and only if it is learnable in the statistical query (SQ) model. Finally, we present a separation between the power of interactive and noninteractive local learning algorithms.},

We explore two possible explanations that do not rely on altruism or explicit mechanisms imposed on the network: direct and indirect private incentives for the provision of public goods. The direct incentive is a traffic redistribution effect that advantages the sharing peer. We find this incentive is likely insufficient to motivate equilibrium content sharing in large networks. We then approach P2P networks as a graph-theoretic problem and present sufficient conditions for sharing and free-riding to co-exist due to indirect incentives we call generalized reciprocity.},

  abstract     = {Incentives for resource sharing are crucial for the proper operation of P2P networks. The principle of the incentive mechanisms in current content sharing P2P networks such as BitTorrent is to have peers exchange content of mutual interest. As a consequence, a peer can actively participate in the system only if it shares content that is of immediate interest to other peers. In this paper we propose to lift this restriction by using bandwidth rather than content as the resource upon which incentives are based. Bandwidth, in contrast to content, is independent of peer interests and so can be exchanged between any two peers. We present the design of a protocol called amortized tit-for-tat (ATFT) based on the bandwidth-exchange concept. This protocol defines mechanisms for bandwidth exchange corresponding to those in BitTorrent for content exchange, in particular for finding bandwidth borrowers that amortize the bandwidth borrowed in the past with their currently idle bandwidth. In addition to the formally proven incentives for bandwidth contributions, ATFT provides natural solutions to the problems of peer bootstrapping, seeding incentive, peer link asymmetry, and anonymity, which have previously been addressed with much more complex designs. Experiments with a realworld dataset confirm that ATFT is efficient in enforcing bandwidth contributions and results in download performance better than provided by incentive mechanisms based on content exchange.},

  abstract    = {Distributed hash tables (DHTs) have been actively studied in literature and many different proposals have been made on how to organize peers in a DHT. However, very few DHTs have been implemented in real systems and deployed on a large scale. One exception is KAD, a DHT based on Kademlia, which is part of eDonkey2000, a peer-to-peer file sharing system with several million simultaneous users. We have been crawling KAD continuously for about six months and obtained information about geographical distribution of peers, session times, peer availability, and peer lifetime. We also evaluated to what extent information about past peer uptime can be used to predict the remaining uptime of the peer. Peers are identified by the so called KAD ID, which was up to now as- sumed to remain the same across sessions. However, we observed that this is not the case: There is a large number of peers, in particular in China, that change their KAD ID, sometimes as frequently as after each session. This change of KAD IDs makes it difficult to characterize end-user availability or membership turnover. By tracking end-users with static IP addresses, we could measure the rate of change of KAD ID per end-user.

  abstract  = {The problem of security against packet timing based traffic analysis in wireless networks is considered in this work. An analytical measure of "anonymity" of routes in eavesdropped networks is proposed using the information-theoretic equivocation. For a physical layer with orthogonal transmitter directed signaling, scheduling and relaying techniques are designed to maximize achievable network performance for any desired level of anonymity. The network performance is measured by the total rate of packets delivered from the sources to destinations under strict latency and medium access constraints. In particular, analytical results are presented for two scenarios: For a single relay that forwards packets from m users, relaying strategies are provided that minimize the packet drops when the source nodes and the relay generate independent transmission schedules. A relay using such an independent scheduling strategy is undetectable by an eavesdropper and is referred to as a covert relay. Achievable rate regions are characterized under strict and average delay constraints on the traffic, when schedules are independent Poisson processes. For a multihop network with an arbitrary anonymity requirement, the problem of maximizing the sum-rate of flows (network throughput) is considered. A randomized selection strategy to choose covert relays as a function of the routes is designed for this purpose. Using the analytical results for a single covert relay, the strategy is optimized to obtain the maximum achievable throughput as a function of the desired level of anonymity. In particular, the throughput-anonymity relation for the proposed strategy is shown to be equivalent to an information-theoretic rate-distortion function.},

  abstract  = {A major problem in tracking objects in sensor networks is trading off update traffic and timeliness of the data that is available to a monitoring site. Typically, either all objects regularly update some central registry with their location information, or the monitoring instance floods the network with a request when it needs information for a particular object. More sophisticated approaches use a P2P-like distributed storage structure on top of geographic routing. The applicability of the latter is limited to certain topologies, and having separate storage and routing algorithms reduces efficiency. In this paper, we present a different solution which is based on the scalable source routing (SSR) protocol. SSR is a network layer routing protocol that has been inspired by distributed hash tables (DHT). It provides key-based routing in large networks of resource-limited devices such as sensor networks. We argue that this approach is more suitable for object tracking in sensor networks because it evenly spreads the updates over the whole network without being limited to a particular network topology. We support our argument with extensive simulations.},

To limit the scope of deanonymization, systems such as "e-cash" have been proposed in which users are deanonymized under only certain types of well-defined misbehavior such as "double spending." While useful in some applications, it is not possible to generalize such techniques to more subjective definitions of misbehavior.

We present the first anonymous credential system in which services can "blacklist" misbehaving users without contacting a TTP. Since blacklisted users remain anonymous, misbehaviors can be judged subjectively without users fearing arbitrary deanonymization by a TTP.},

These applications often store weakly structured data, requiring sophisticated search algorithms. To simplify the search problem, most scalable algorithms introduce structure to the network. However, churn or violent disruption may break this structure, compromising search guarantees.

This paper proposes a simple probabilistic search system, BubbleStorm, built on random multigraphs. Our primary contribution is a flexible and reliable strategy for performing exhaustive search. BubbleStorm also exploits the heterogeneous bandwidth of peers. However, we sacrifice some of this bandwidth for high parallelism and low latency. The provided search guarantees are tunable, with success probability adjustable well into the realm of reliable systems.

For validation, we simulate a network with one million low-end peers and show BubbleStorm handles up to 90\% simultaneous peer departure and 50\% simultaneous crash.},

  abstract     = {Due to the high availability of the Internet, many large cross-organization collaboration projects, such as SourceForge, grid systems etc., have emerged. One of the fundamental requirements of these collaboration efforts is a storage system to store and exchange data. This storage system must be highly scalable and can efficiently aggregate the storage resources contributed by the participating organizations to deliver good performance for users. In this paper, we propose a storage system, Collaborative File Repository (CFR), for large scale collaboration projects. CFR uses peer-to-peer techniques to achieve scalability, efficiency, and ease of management. In CFR, storage nodes contributed by the participating organizations are partitioned according to geographical regions. Files stored in CFR are automatically replicated to all regions. Furthermore, popular files are duplicated to other storage nodes of the same region. By doing so, data transfers between users and storage nodes are confined within their regions and transfer efficiency is enhanced. Experiments show that our replication can achieve high efficiency with a small number of duplicates.},

  abstract  = {Real-time, interactive, multi-user (RIM) applications are networked applications that allow users to collaborate and interact with each other over the Internet for work, education and training, or entertainment purposes. Multiplayer games, distance learning applications, collaborative whiteboards, immersive educational and training simulations, and distributed interactive simulations are examples of these applications. Of these RIM applications, multiplayer games are an important class for research due to their widespread deployment and popularity on the Internet. Research with multiplayer games will have a direct impact on all RIM applications.

While large-scale multiplayer games have typically used a client/server architecture for network communication, we propose using a peer-to-peer architecture to solve the scalability problems inherent in centralized systems. Past research and actual deployments of peer-to-peer networks show that they can scale to millions of users. However, these prior peer-to-peer networks do not meet the low latency and interactive requirements that multi-player games need. Indeed, the fundamental problem of maintaining consistency between all nodes in the face of failures, delays, and malicious attacks has to be solved to make a peer-to-peer networks a viable solution.

We propose solving the consistency problem through secure and scalable event ordering. While traditional event ordering requires all-to-all message passing and at least two rounds of communication, we argue that multiplayer games lend themselves naturally to a hierarchical decomposition of their state space so that we can reduce the communication cost of event ordering. We also argue that by using cryptography, a discrete view of time, and majority voting, we can totally order events in a real-time setting. By applying these two concepts, we can scale multiplayer games to millions of players.

We develop our solution in two parts: a cheat-proof and real-time event ordering protocol and a scalable, hierarchical structure that organizes peers in a tree according to their scope of interest in the game. Our work represents the first, complete solution to this problem and we show through both proofs and simulations that our protocols allow the creation of large-scale, peer-to-peer games that are resistant to cheating while maintaining real-time responsiveness in the system.

  abstract  = {The Internet{\textquoteright}s routing system is facing stresses due to its poor fundamental scaling properties. Compact routing is a research field that studies fundamental limits of routing scalability and designs algorithms that try to meet these limits. In particular, compact routing research shows that shortest-path routing, forming a core of traditional routing algorithms, cannot guarantee routing table (RT) sizes that on all network topologies grow slower than linearly as functions of the network size. However, there are plenty of compact routing schemes that relax the shortest-path requirement and allow for improved, sublinear RT size scaling that is mathematically provable for all static network topologies. In particular, there exist compact routing schemes designed for grids, trees, and Internet-like topologies that offer RT sizes that scale logarithmically with the network size.

In this paper, we demonstrate that in view of recent results in compact routing research, such logarithmic scaling on Internet-like topologies is fundamentally impossible in the presence of topology dynamics or topology-independent (flat) addressing. We use analytic arguments to show that the number of routing control messages per topology change cannot scale better than linearly on Internet-like topologies. We also employ simulations to confirm that logarithmic RT size scaling gets broken by topology-independent addressing, a cornerstone of popular locator-identifier split proposals aiming at improving routing scaling in the presence of network topology dynamics or host mobility. These pessimistic findings lead us to the conclusion that a fundamental re-examination of assumptions behind routing models and abstractions is needed in order to find a routing architecture that would be able to scale "indefinitely.

However, few mechanisms are available to reduce the risk of losing the data stored on these devices. In this dissertation, we try to address this concern by designing a cooperative backup service for mobile devices. The service leverages encounters and spontaneous interactions among participating devices, such that each device stores data on behalf of other devices. We first provide an analytical evaluation of the dependability gains of the proposed service. Distributed storage mechanisms are explored and evaluated. Security concerns arising from thecooperation among mutually suspicious principals are identified, and core mechanisms are proposed to allow them to be addressed. Finally, we present our prototype implementation of the cooperative backup service.},

However, using long-term statistical analysis of traffic sent to and from such a system, it is possible to link senders with their receivers. Cover traffic is an effective, but somewhat limited, counter strategy against this attack. Earlier work in this area proposes that privacy-sensitive users generate and send cover traffic to the system. However, users are not online all the time and cannot be expected to send consistent levels of cover traffic, drastically reducing the impact of cover traffic. We propose that the mix generate cover traffic that mimics the sending patterns of users in the system. This receiver-bound cover helps to make up for users that aren{\textquoteright}t there, confusing the attacker. We show through simulation how this makes it difficult for an attacker to discern cover from real traffic and perform attacks based on statistical analysis. Our results show that receiver-bound cover substantially increases the time required for these attacks to succeed. When our approach is used in combination with user-generated cover traffic, the attack takes a very long time to succeed.},

  abstract  = {The spread of wide-scale Internet surveillance has spurred interest in anonymity systems that protect users{\textquoteright} privacy by restricting unauthorised access to their identity. This requirement can be considered as a flow control policy in the well established field of multilevel secure systems. I apply previous research on covert channels (unintended means to communicate in violation of a security policy) to analyse several anonymity systems in an innovative way.
One application for anonymity systems is to prevent collusion in competitions. I show how covert channels may be exploited to violate these protections and construct defences against such attacks, drawing from previous covert channel research and collusion-resistant voting systems.
In the military context, for which multilevel secure systems were designed, covert channels are increasingly eliminated by physical separation of interconnected single-role computers. Prior work on the remaining network covert channels has been solely based on protocol specifications. I examine some protocol implementations and show how the use of several covert channels can be detected and how channels can be modified to resist detection.
I show how side channels (unintended information leakage) in anonymity networks may reveal the behaviour of users. While drawing on previous research on traffic analysis and covert channels, I avoid the traditional assumption of an omnipotent adversary. Rather, these attacks are feasible for an attacker with limited access to the network. The effectiveness of these techniques is demonstrated by experiments on a deployed anonymity network, Tor.
Finally, I introduce novel covert and side channels which exploit thermal effects. Changes in temperature can be remotely induced through CPU load and measured by their effects on crystal clock skew. Experiments show this to be an effective attack against Tor. This side channel may also be usable for geolocation and, as a covert channel, can cross supposedly infallible air-gap security boundaries.
This thesis demonstrates how theoretical models and generic methodologies relating to covert channels may be applied to find practical solutions to problems in real-world anonymity systems. These findings confirm the existing hypothesis that covert channel analysis, vulnerabilities and defences developed for multilevel secure systems apply equally well to anonymity systems.},

While BitTorrent has been extremely successful, we show that its incentive mechanism is not robust to strategic clients. Through performance modeling parameterized by real world traces, we demonstrate that all peers contribute resources that do not directly improve their performance. We use these results to drive the design and implementation of BitTyrant, a strategic BitTorrent client that provides a median 70\% performance gain for a 1 Mbit client on live Internet swarms. We further show that when applied universally, strategic clients can hurt average per-swarm performance compared to today{\textquoteright}s BitTorrent client implementations.},

  year      = {2007},
  abstract  = {Although recent years provided many protocols for anonymous routing in overlay networks, they commonly rely on the same communication paradigm: Onion Routing. In Onion Routing a static tunnel through an overlay network is build via layered encryption. All traffic exchanged by its end points is relayed through this tunnel. In contrast, this paper introduces dynamic multipath Onion Routing to extend the static Onion Routing paradigm. This approach allows each packet exchanged between two end points to travel along a different path. To provide anonymity the first half of this path is selected by the sender and the second half by the receiver of the packet. The results are manifold: First, dynamic multipath Onion Routing increases the resilience against threats, especially pattern and timing based analysis attacks. Second, the dynamic paths reduce the impact of misbehaving and overloaded relays. Finally, inspired by Internet routing, the forwarding nodes do not need to maintain any state about ongoing flows and so reduce the complexity of the router. In this paper, we describe the design of our dynamic Multipath Onion RoutEr (MORE) for peer-to-peer overlay networks, and evaluate its performance. Furthermore, we integrate address virtualization to abstract from Internet addresses and provide transparent support for IP applications. Thus, no application-level gateways, proxies or modifications of applications are required to sanitize protocols from network level information. Acting as an IP-datagram service, our scheme provides a substrate for anonymous communication to a wide range of applications using TCP and UDP.},

  abstract     = {A Monte-Carlo evaluation consists in estimating a position by averaging the outcome of several random continuations. The method can serve as an evaluation function at the leaves of a min-max tree. This paper presents a new framework to combine tree search with Monte-Carlo evaluation, that does not separate between a min-max phase and a Monte-Carlo phase. Instead of backing-up the min-max value close to the root, and the average value at some depth, a more general backup operator is defined that progressively changes from averaging to minmax as the number of simulations grows. This approach provides a finegrained control of the tree growth, at the level of individual simulations, and allows efficient selectivity. The resulting algorithm was implemented in a 9 {\texttimes} 9 Go-playing program, Crazy Stone, that won the 10th KGS computer-Go tournament.},

This article presents an overview of application and network layer mechanisms that enable successful streaming frameworks in peer-to-peer systems. We describe media delivery architectures that can be deployed over P2P networks to address the specific requirements of streaming applications. In particular, we show how video-streaming applications can benefit from the diversity offered by P2P systems and implement distributed-streaming and scheduling solutions with multi-path packet transmission.},

  abstract  = {Dual-radio, dual-processor nodes are an emerging class of Wireless Sensor Network devices that provide both lowenergy operation as well as substantially increased computational performance and communication bandwidth for applications. In such systems, the secondary radio and processor operates with sufficiently low power that it may remain always vigilant, while the the main processor and primary, high-bandwidth radio remain off until triggered by the application. By exploiting the high energy efficiency of the main processor and primary radio along with proper usage, net operating energy benefits are enabled for applications. The secondary radio provides a constantly available multi-hop network, while paths in the primary network exist only when required. This paper describes a topology control mechanism for establishing an end-to-end path in a network of dual-radio nodes using the secondary radios as a control channel to selectively wake up nodes along the required end-to-end path. Using numerical models as well as testbed experimentation, we show that our proposed mechanism provides significant energy savings of more than 60 \% compared to alternative approaches, and that it incurs only moderately greater application latency.},

Users care about their privacy and they seek for new ways to keep secret as much as of their personal information from third parties. Anonymizing systems exist nowadays that provide users with the technology, which is able to hide their origin when they use applications such as the World Wide Web or Instant Messaging. However, all these systems are vulnerable to a number of attacks and some of them may collapse under a low strength adversary. In this paper we explore anonymity from a different perspective. Instead of building a new anonymizing system, we try to overload an existing file sharing system, Gnutella, and use it for a different purpose. We develop a technique that transforms Gnutella as an Anonymizing System (GAS) for a single download from the World Wide Web.},

We have been crawling <scp>KAD</scp> continuously for about six months and obtained information about the total number of peers online and their geographical distribution.

Peers are identified by the so called KAD ID, which was up to now assumed to remain the same across sessions. However, we observed that this is not the case: There is a large number of peers, in particular in China, that change their KAD ID, sometimes as frequently as after each session. This change of KAD IDs makes it difficult to characterize end-user availability or membership turnover.},

This paper factors out a fundamental mechanism at the heart of all these protocols: the peer-sampling service. In short, this service provides every node with peers to gossip with. We promote this service to the level of a first-class abstraction of a large-scale distributed system, similar to a name service being a first-class abstraction of a local-area system. We present a generic framework to implement a peer-sampling service in a decentralized manner by constructing and maintaining dynamic unstructured overlays through gossiping membership information itself. Our framework generalizes existing approaches and makes it easy to discover new ones. We use this framework to empirically explore and compare several implementations of the peer sampling service. Through extensive simulation experiments we show that---although all protocols provide a good quality uniform random stream of peers to each node locally---traditional theoretical assumptions about the randomness of the unstructured overlays as a whole do not hold in any of the instances. We also show that different design decisions result in severe differences from the point of view of two crucial aspects: load balancing and fault tolerance. Our simulations are validated by means of a wide-area implementation.},

However, their simplicity, robustness, and flexibility make them attractive for more than just pure data dissemination alone. In particular, gossiping has been applied to data aggregation, overlay maintenance, and resource allocation. Gossiping applications more or less fit the same framework, with often subtle differences in algorithmic details determining divergent emergent behavior. This divergence is often difficult to understand, as formal models have yet to be developed that can capture the full design space of gossiping solutions. In this paper, we present a brief introduction to the field of gossiping in distributed systems, by providing a simple framework and using that framework to describe solutions for various application domains.},

Therefore, in the absence of incentives to the contrary, rational (i.e., selfish) intermediaries may choose to forward messages at a low priority or simply not forward messages at all. Using a principal-agent model, we show how the hidden-action problem can be overcome through appropriate design of contracts in both the direct (the endpoints contract with each individual router directly) and the recursive (each router contracts with the next downstream router) cases. We further show that, depending on the network topology, per-hop or per-path monitoring may not necessarily improve the utility of the principal or the social welfare of the system.},

Finally, we give a distributed protocol for sampling and obfuscating each of the above shuffles and show how it can be used in a trivial way to construct a universally composable mix-net. Our constructions are practical when the number of senders N is small, yet large enough to handle a number of practical cases, e.g. N = 350 in the BGN case and N = 2000 in the Paillier case.},

We eliminate the use of RSA encryption and decryption from circuit setup, and we reduce the number of DH exponentiations vs. the current Tor circuit setup protocol while maintaining immediate forward secrecy. We also describe savings that can be obtained by precomputing during idle cycles values that can be determined before the protocol starts. We introduce the distinction of eventual vs. immediate forward secrecy and present protocols that illustrate the distinction. These protocols are even more efficient in communication and computation than the one we primarily propose, but they provide only eventual forward secrecy. We describe how to reduce the overhead and the complexity of hidden server connections by using our DH-values to implement valet nodes and eliminate the need for rendezvous points as they exist today. We also discuss the security of the new elements and an analysis of efficiency improvements.},

  abstract  = {In Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), nodes depend upon each other for routing and forwarding packets. However, nodes belonging to independent authorities in MANETs may behave selfishly and may not forward packets to save battery and other resources. To stimulate cooperation, nodes are rewarded for their forwarding service. Since nodes spend different cost to forward packets, it is desirable to reimburse nodes according to their cost so that nodes get incentive while the least total payment is charged to the sender. However, to maximize their utility, nodes may tell lie about their cost. This poses the requirement of truthful protocols, which maximizes the utility of nodes only when they declare their true cost. Anderegg and Eidenbenz recently proposed a truthful routing protocol, named ad hoc-VCG. This protocol incurs the route discovery overhead of O(n3), where n is the number of nodes in the network. This routing overhead is likely to become prohibitively large as the network size grows. Moreover, it leads to low network performance due to congestion and interference. We present a low-overhead truthful routing protocol for route discovery in MANETs with selfish nodes by applying mechanism design. The protocol, named LOTTO (Low Overhead Truthful rouTing prOtocol), finds a least cost path for data forwarding with a lower routing overhead of O(n2). We conduct an extensive simulation study to evaluate the performance of our protocol and compare it with ad hoc-VCG. Simulation results show that our protocol provides a much higher packet delivery ratio, generates much lower overhead and has much lower end-to-end delay.},

Many variants of the basic PIR model have been proposed, including such modifications as computational vs. information-theoretic privacy protection, correctness in the face of servers that fail to respond or that respond incorrectly, and protection of sensitive data against the database servers themselves. In this paper, we improve on the robustness of PIR in a number of ways. First, we present a Byzantine-robust PIR protocol which provides information-theoretic privacy protection against coalitions of up to all but one of the responding servers, improving the previous result by a factor of 3. In addition, our protocol allows for more of the responding servers to return incorrect information while still enabling the user to compute the correct result. We then extend our protocol so that queries have information-theoretic protection if a limited number of servers collude, as before, but still retain computational protection if they all collude. We also extend the protocol to provide information-theoretic protection to the contents of the database against collusions of limited numbers of the database servers, at no additional communication cost or increase in the number of servers. All of our protocols retrieve a block of data with communication cost only O(.) times the size of the block, where . is the number of servers.},

Typically, anonymizers use onion routing, where a message is encrypted in layers with the public keys of the nodes along the path. Instead, our approach scrambles the message, divides it into pieces, and sends the pieces along disjoint paths. We show that information slicing addresses message confidentiality as well as source and destination anonymity. Surprisingly, it does not need any public key cryptography. Further, our approach naturally addresses the problem of node failures. These characteristics make it a good fit for use over dynamic peer-to-peer overlays. We evaluate the anonymity ofinformation slicing via analysis and simulations. Our prototype implementation on PlanetLab shows that it achieves higher throughput than onion routing and effectively copes with node churn.},

  abstract  = {has been made resistant to jamming by the use of a secret key that is shared by the sender and receiver. There are no known methods for achieving jam resistance without that shared key. Unfortunately, wireless communication is now reaching a scale and a level of importance where such secret-key systems are becoming impractical. For example, the civilian side of the Global Positioning System (GPS) cannot use a shared secret, since that secret would have to be given to all 6.5 billion potential users, and so would no longer be secret. So civilian GPS cannot currently be protected from jamming. But the FAA has stated that the civilian airline industry will transition to using GPS for all navigational aids, even during landings. A terrorist with a simple jamming system could wreak havoc at a major airport. No existing system can solve this problem, and the problem itself has not even been widely discussed. The problem of keyless jam resistance is important. There is a great need for a system that can broadcast messages without any prior secret shared between the sender and receiver. We propose the first system for keyless jam resistance: the BBC algorithm. We describe the encoding, decoding, and broadcast algorithms. We then analyze it for expected resistance to jamming and error rates. We show that BBC can achieve the same level of jam resistance as traditional spread spectrum systems, at just under half the bit rate, and with no shared secret. Furthermore, a hybrid system can achieve the same average bit rate as traditional systems.},

We investigate how Tor{\^a}s routing optimizations impact its ability to provide strong anonymity. Through experiments conducted on PlanetLab, we show the extent to which routing performance optimizations have left the system vulnerable to end-to-end traffic analysis attacks from non-global adversaries with minimal resources. Further, we demonstrate that entry guards, added to mitigate path disruption attacks, are themselves vulnerable to attack. Finally, we explore solutions to improve Tor{\^a}s current routing algorithms and propose alternative routing strategies that prevent some of the routing attacks used in our experiments.},

This challenge cannot be fully met by traditional incentive schemes, which suffer from various attacks based on false reports. Especially, due to the lack of central authorities in typical P2P systems, it is difficult to detect colluding groups. Members in the same colluding group can cooperate to manipulate their history information, and the damaging power increases dramatically with the group size. In this paper, we propose a new distributed incentive scheme, in which the benefit that a node can obtain from the system is proportional to its contribution to the system, and a colluding group cannot gain advantage by cooperation regardless of its size. Consequently, the damaging power of colluding groups is strictly limited. The proposed scheme includes three major components: a distributed authority infrastructure, a key sharing protocol, and a contract verification protocol.},

In this paper, we compare and contrast the performance of representative protocols from each class using simulations. We identify the similarities and differences between these two approaches. Furthermore, we separately examine the behavior of content delivery and overlay construction mechanisms for both approaches in static and dynamic scenarios. Our results indicate that the mesh-based approach consistently exhibits a superior performance over the tree-based approach. We also show that the main factors attributing in the inferior performance of the tree-based approach are (i) the static mapping of content to a particular tree, and (ii) the placement of each peer as an internal node in one tree and as a leaf in all other trees.},

[11] showed a novel technique to convert a polynomial sharing of secret a into the sharings of the bits of a in constant rounds, which is called the bit-decomposition protocol. The bit-decomposition protocol is a very powerful tool because it enables bit-oriented operations even if shared secrets are given as elements in the field. However, the bit-decomposition protocol is relatively expensive.
In this paper, we present a simplified bit-decomposition protocol by analyzing the original protocol. Moreover, we construct more efficient protocols for a comparison, interval test and equality test of shared secrets without relying on the bit-decomposition protocol though it seems essential to such bit-oriented operations. The key idea is that we do computation on secret a with c and r where c = a + r, c is a revealed value, and r is a random bitwise-shared secret. The outputs of these protocols are also shared without being revealed.
The realized protocols as well as the original protocol are constant-round and run with less communication rounds and less data communication than those of [11]. For example, the round complexities are reduced by a factor of approximately 3 to 10.},

We demonstrate the significant advantage of optimal (or near optimal) solutions. Hence, we investigate multipath routing adopting a rigorous (theoretical) approach. We formalize problems that incorporate two major requirements of multipath routing. Then, we establish the intractability of these problems in terms of computational complexity.

Application scenarios include data centers, peer-to-peer storage systems, and storage in wireless networks. Storing data using an erasure code, in fragments spread across nodes, requires less redundancy than simple replication for the same level of reliability. However, since fragments must be periodically replaced as nodes fail, a key question is how to generate encoded fragments in a distributed way while transferring as little data as possible across the network. For an erasure coded system, a common practice to repair from a single node failure is for a new node to reconstruct the whole encoded data object to generate just one encoded block. We show that this procedure is sub-optimal. We introduce the notion of regenerating codes, which allow a new node to communicate functions of the stored data from the surviving nodes. We show that regenerating codes can significantly reduce the repair bandwidth. Further, we show that there is a fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth which we theoretically characterize using flow arguments on an appropriately constructed graph. By invoking constructive results in network coding, we introduce regenerating codes that can achieve any point in this optimal tradeoff.},

In privacy-preserving data mining, data is distributed across several parties. The efficiency of secure scalar products is important, not only because they can cause overhead in communication cost, but dot product operations also serve as one of the basic building blocks for many other secure protocols.

Although several solutions exist in the relevant literature for this problem, the need for more efficient and more practical solutions still remains. In this paper, we present a very efficient and very practical secure scalar product protocol. We compare it to the most common scalar product protocols. We not only show that our protocol is much more efficient than the existing ones, we also provide experimental results by using a real life dataset.},

We present the ParaNets architecture and discuss its short-term challenges and longterm implications. We also argue, based on current research trends and the ParaNets architecture, for the evolution of the conventional protocol stack to a more flexible cross-layered protocol tree. To demonstrate the potential impact of ParaNets, we use Delay Tolerant Mobile Networks (DTMNs) as a representative challenged network over which we evaluate ParaNets. Our ultimate goal in this paper is to open the way for further work in challenged networks using ParaNets as the underlying architecture.},

We introduce PC-DPOP, a new partial centralization technique, based on the DPOP algorithm of [Petcu and Faltings, 2005]. PC-DPOP provides better control over what parts of the problem are centralized and allows this centralization to be optimal with respect to the chosen communication structure.

Unlike OptAPO, PC-DPOP allows for a priory, exact predictions about privacy loss, communication, memory and computational requirements on all nodes and links in the network. Upper bounds on communication and memory requirements can be specified.

We also report strong efficiency gains over OptAPO in experiments on three problem domains.},

It is especially suited for organically growing networks of many resource-limited mobile devices supported by a few fixed-wired nodes. SSR is a full-fledged network layer routing protocol that directly provides the semantics of a structured peer-to-peer network. Hence, it can serve as an efficient basis for fully decentralized applications on mobile devices. SSR combines source routing in the physical network with Chord-like routing in the virtual ring formed by the address space. Message forwarding greedily decreases the distance in the virtual ring while preferring physically short paths. Thereby, scalability is achieved without imposing artificial hierarchies or assigning location-dependent addresses},

In this paper, we consider a variant of Yao{\textquoteright}s problem in which the inputs x,y as well as the output bit x > y are encrypted. Referring to the framework of secure n-party computation based on threshold homomorphic cryptosystems as put forth by Cramer, Damg{\r a}rd, and Nielsen at Eurocrypt 2001, we develop solutions for integer comparison, which take as input two lists of encrypted bits representing x and y, respectively, and produce an encrypted bit indicating whether x > y as output. Secure integer comparison is an important building block for applications such as secure auctions.
In this paper, our focus is on the two-party case, although most of our results extend to the multi-party case. We propose new logarithmic-round and constant-round protocols for this setting, which achieve simultaneously very low communication and computational complexities. We analyze the protocols in detail and show that our solutions compare favorably to other known solutions.},

  abstract     = {The success of file swarming mechanisms such as BitTorrent has motivated a new approach for scalable streaming of live content that we call mesh-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) streaming. In this approach, participating end-systems (or peers) form a randomly connected mesh and incorporate swarming content delivery to stream live content. Despite the growing popularity of this approach, neither the fundamental design tradeoffs nor the basic performance bottlenecks in mesh-based P2P streaming are well understood.

In this paper, we follow a performance-driven approach to design PRIME, a scalable mesh-based P2P streaming mechanism for live content. The main design goal of PRIME is to minimize two performance bottlenecks, namely bandwidth bottleneck and content bottleneck. We show that the global pattern of delivery for each segment of live content should consist of a diffusion phase which is followed by a swarming phase. This leads to effective utilization of available resources to accommodate scalability and also minimizes content bottleneck. Using packet level simulations, we carefully examine the impact of overlay connectivity, packet scheduling scheme at individual peers and source behavior on the overall performance of the system. Our results reveal fundamental design tradeoffs of mesh-based P2P streaming for live content.},

However, effective personalized search requires collecting and aggregating user information, which often raise serious concerns of privacy infringement for many users. Indeed, these concerns have become one of the main barriers for deploying personalized search applications, and how to do privacy-preserving personalization is a great challenge. In this paper, we systematically examine the issue of privacy preservation in personalized search. We distinguish and define four levels of privacy protection, and analyze various software architectures for personalized search. We show that client-side personalization has advantages over the existing server-side personalized search services in preserving privacy, and envision possible future strategies to fully protect user privacy.},

  abstract  = {As the number of Internet activities increases, there is a growing amount of personal information about the users that is transferred using public electronic means, making it feasible to collect a huge amount of information about a person. As a consequence, the need for mechanisms to protect such information is compelling. In this thesis, we study security protocols with an emphasis on the property of anonymity and we propose methods to express and verify this property. 

Anonymity protocols often use randomization to introduce noise, thus limiting the inference power of a malicious observer. We consider a probabilistic framework in which a protocol is described by its set of anonymous information, observable information and the conditional probability of observing the latter given the former. In this framework we express two anonymity properties, namely strong anonymity and probable innocence. 

Then we aim at quantitative definitions of anonymity. We view protocols as noisy channels in the information-theoretic sense and we express their degree of anonymity as the converse of channel capacity. We apply this definition to two known anonymity protocols. We develop a monotonicity principle for the capacity, and use it to show a number of results for binary channels in the context of algebraic information theory. We then study the probability of error for the attacker in the context of Bayesian inference, showing that it is a piecewise linear function and using this fact to improve known bounds from the literature. 

Finally we study a problem that arises when we combine probabilities with nondeterminism, where the scheduler is too powerful even for trivially secure protocols. We propose a process calculus which allows to express restrictions to the scheduler, and we use it in the analysis of an anonymity and a contract-signing protocol.},

Our main result is a constructive characterization of a convex base of the probability of error, which allows us to compute its maximum value (over all possible input distributions), and to identify upper bounds for it in terms of simple functions. As a side result, we are able to improve substantially the Hellman-Raviv and the Santhi-Vardy bounds expressed in terms of conditional entropy. We then discuss an application of our methodology to the Crowds protocol, and in particular we show how to compute the bounds on the probability that an adversary breaks anonymity.},

  abstract  = {Unfortunately, from all known "Distributed Hash Table"-based overlay networks only a few of them relate to proximity in terms of latency. So a query routing can come with high latency when very distant hops are used. One can imagine hops are from one continent to the other in terms of here and back. Thereby it is possible that the target node is located close to the requesting node. Such cases increase query latency to a great extent and are responsible for performance bottlenecks of a query routing.
There exist two main strategies to reduce latency in the query routing process: Proximity Neighbor Selection and Proximity Route Selection. As a new proposal of PNS for the IGOR overlay network, Merivaldi is developed. Merivaldi represents a combination of two basic ideas: The first idea is the Meridian framework and its Closest-Node- Discovery without synthetic coordinates. The second idea is Vivaldi, a distributed algorithm for predicting Internet latency between arbitrary Internet hosts. Merivaldi is quite similar to Meridian. It differs in using no direct Round Trip Time measurements like Meridian does to obtain latency characteristics between hosts. Merivaldi obtains latency characteristics of nodes using the latency prediction derived from the Vivaldi-coordinates. A Merivaldi-node forms exponentially growing latency-rings, i.e., the rings correspond to latency distances to the Merivaldi-node itself. In these rings node-references are inserted with regard to their latency characteristics. These node-references are obtained through a special protocol. A Merivaldi-node finds latency-closest nodes through periodic querying its ring-members for closer nodes. If a closer node is found by a ring-member the query is forwarded to this one until no closer one can be found. The closest on this way reports itself to the Merivaldi-node.
Exemplary analysis show that Merivaldi means only a modest burden for the network. Merivaldi uses O(log N) CND-hops at maximum to recognize a closest node, where N is the number of nodes. Empirical tests demonstrate this analysis. Analysis shows, the overhead for a Merivaldi-node is modest. It is shown that Merivaldi{\textquoteright}s Vivaldi works with high quality with the used PING-message type.},

The management of existing operating systems is strongly imperative in nature, since software packages and configuration data (e.g., /bin and /etc in Unix) can be seen as imperative data structures: they are updated in-place by system administration actions. In this paper we present an alternative approach to system configuration management: a purely functional method, analogous to languages like Haskell. In this approach, the static parts of a configuration -- software packages, configuration files, control scripts -- are built from pure functions, i.e., the results depend solely on the specified inputs of the function and are immutable. As a result, realising a system configuration becomes deterministic and reproducible. Upgrading to a new configuration is mostly atomic and doesn{\textquoteright}t overwrite anything of the old configuration, thus enabling rollbacks.

  abstract     = {In many networks, such as mobile ad-hoc networks and friend-to-friend overlay networks, direct communication between nodes is limited to specific neighbors.  Often these networks have a small-world topology; while short paths exist between any pair of nodes in small-world networks, it is non-trivial to determine such paths with a distributed algorithm.  Recently, Clarke and Sandberg
proposed the first decentralized routing algorithm that achieves efficient routing in such small-world networks.

This paper is the first independent security analysis of Clarke and Sandberg{\textquoteright}s routing algorithm. We show that a relatively weak participating adversary can render the overlay ineffective without being detected, resulting in significant data loss due to the resulting load imbalance.  We have measured the impact of the attack
in a testbed of 800 nodes using minor modifications to Clarke and Sandberg{\textquoteright}s implementation of their routing algorithm in Freenet. Our experiments show that the attack is highly effective, allowing a small number of malicious nodes to cause rapid loss of data on the entire network.

We also discuss various proposed countermeasures designed to detect, thwart or limit the attack. While we were unable to find effective countermeasures, we hope that the presented analysis will be a first step towards the design of secure distributed routing algorithms for restricted-route topologies.},

Previous work has shown that simply ensuring geographical diversity of nodes does not resist, and in some cases exacerbates, the risk of traffic analysis by ISPs. Ensuring high autonomous-system (AS) diversity can resist this weakness. However, ISPs commonly connect to many other ISPs in a single location, known as an Internet eXchange (IX). This paper shows that IXes are a single point where traffic analysis can be performed. We examine to what extent this is true, through a case study of Tor nodes in the UK. Also, some IXes sample packets flowing through them for performance analysis reasons, and this data could be exploited to de-anonymize traffic. We then develop and evaluate Bayesian traffic analysis techniques capable of processing this sampled data.},

  abstract  = {Distributed file systems have been a topic of interest for a long time and there are many file systems that are distributed in one way or another. However most distributed file systems are only reasonably usable within a local network of computers and some main tasks are still delegated to a very small number of servers.
Today with the advent of Peer-to-Peer technology, distributed file systems that work on top of Peer-to-Peer systems can be built. These systems can be built with no or much less centralised components and are usable on a global scale.
The System Architecture Group at the University of Karlsruhe in Germany has developedsuch a file system, which is built on top of a structured overlay network and uses Distributed Hash Tables to store and access the information.
One problem with this approach is, that each file system can only be accessed with the help of an identifier, which changes whenever a file system is modified. All clients have to be notified of the new identifier in a secure, fast and reliable way.
Usually the strategy to solve this type of problem is an encrypted multicast. This thesis presents and analyses several strategies of using multicast distributions to solve this problem and then unveils our final solution based on the Subset Difference method proposed by Naor et al.

Then we show, that the obtained model can be generalized in the sense that the parameters of a filtercalibrated at a node can be used effectively to model and predict the dynamic behavior at another node, as long as the two nodes are not too far apart in the network. This leads to the proposal of a Surveyor infrastructure: Surveyor nodes are trusted, honest nodes that use each other exclusively to position themselves in the coordinate space, and are therefore immune to malicious behavior in the system.During their own coordinate embedding, other nodes can thenuse the filter parameters of a nearby Surveyor as a representation of normal, clean system behavior to detect and filter out abnormal or malicious activity. A combination of simulations and PlanetLab experiments are used to demonstrate the validity, generality, and effectiveness of the proposed approach for two representative coordinate embedding systems, namely Vivaldi and NPS.},

  abstract     = {We present a flexible framework for throttling attackers in peer-to-peer media streaming systems. In such systems, selfish nodes (e.g., free riders) and malicious nodes (e.g., DoS attackers) can overwhelm the system by issuing too many requests in a short interval of time. Since peer-to-peer systems are decentralized, it is difficult for individual peers to limit the aggregate download bandwidth consumed by other remote peers. This could potentially allow selfish and malicious peers to exhaust the system{\textquoteright}s available upload bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a framework to provide a solution to this problem by utilizing a subset of trusted peers (called kantoku nodes) that collectively monitor the bandwidth usage of untrusted peers in the system and throttle attackers. This framework has been evaluated through simulation thus far. Experiments with a full implementation on a network testbed are part of our future work.},

This paper discusses security considerations that arise in the design of a cooperative backup service for mobile devices. Participating devices leverage encounters with other devices to temporarily replicate critical data. Anyone is free to participate in the cooperative service, without requiring any prior trust relationship with other participants. In this paper, we identify security threats relevant in this context as well as possible solutions and discuss how they map to low-level security requirements related to identity and trust establishment. We propose self-organized, policy-neutral mechanisms that allow the secure designation and identification of participating devices. We show that they can serve as a building block for a wide range of cooperation policies that address most of the security threats we are concerned with. We conclude on future directions.},

Although several suggestions exist on how to create a secure key-based routing protocol, a practicable approach is still unattended. In this paper we introduce a secure key-based routing protocol based on Kademlia that has a high resilience against common attacks by using parallel lookups over multiple disjoint paths, limiting free nodeId generation with crypto puzzles and introducing a reliable sibling broadcast. The latter is needed to store data in a safe replicated way. We evaluate the security of our proposed extensions to the Kademlia protocol analytically and simulate the effects of multiple disjoint paths on lookup success under the influence of adversarial nodes.},

[5], provide a mechanism by which users can retrieve information from a database distributed across multiple servers in such a way that neither the servers nor an outside observer can determine the contents of the data being retrieved. More recent PIR protocols also provide protection against Byzantine servers, such that a user can detect when one or more servers have attempted to tamper with the data he has requested. In some cases (as in the protocols presented by Beimel and Stahl [1]), the user can still recover his data and protect the contents of his query if the number of Byzantine servers is below a certain threshold; this property is referred to as Byzantine-recovery. However, tampering with a user{\textquoteright}s data is not the only goal a Byzantine server might have. We present a scenario in which an arbitrarily sized coalition of Byzantine servers transforms the userbase of a PIR network into a signaling framework with varying levels of detectability by means of a subliminal channel [11]. We describe several such subliminal channel techniques, illustrate several use-cases for this subliminal channel, and demonstrate its applicability to a wide variety of PIR protocols.},

The resulting code is often unportable, system specific and demands deep knowledge of the hardware details. This paper motivates the use of Java as an alternative programming language. We focus on the tiny AmbiComp Virtual Machine (ACVM) which we currently develop as the main part of a more general Java based development platform for interconnected sensor nodes. This VM is designed to run on different small embedded devices in a distributed network. It uses the novel scalable source routing (SSR) algorithm to distribute and share data and workload. SSR provides key based routing which enables distributed hash table (DHT) structures as a substrate for the VM to disseminate and access remote code and objects. This approach allows all VMs in the network to collaborate. The result looks like one large, distributed VM which supports a subset of the Java language. The ACVM substitutes functionality of an operating system which is missing on the target platform. As this development is work in progress, we outline the ideas behind this approach to provide first insights into the upcoming problems.},

We pose a grand challenge for anonymity: the development of a network architecture that enables applications to customize routes that tradeoff between anonymity and performance. Towards this challenge, we present the Application-Aware Anonymity (A3) routing service. We envision that A3 will serve as a powerful and flexible anonymous communications layer that will spur the future development of anonymity services.

The rationale is to have every participant in the system act both as a client (information consumer) and as a server (information dissemination enabler), thus, precluding specific brokers which would prevent scalability and fault-tolerance. We argue that, for such decentralized architectures to be really meaningful, participants should serve the system as much as they benefit from it. That is, the system should be fair in the sense that the extend to which a participant acts as a server should depend on the extend to which it has the opportunity to act as a client. This is particularly crucial in selective information dissemination schemes where clients are not all interested in the same information. In this position paper, we discuss what a notion of fairness could look like, explain why current architectures are not fair, and raise several challenges towards achieving fairness.},

In this paper, we disprove their claims by presenting traffic analysis attacks on the file update algorithm of Zhou et al. Our attacks are highly effective in detecting file updates and revealing the existence and location of files. For multi-block files, we show that two updates are sufficient to discover the file. One-block files accessed a sufficient number of times can also be revealed. Our results suggest that simple randomization techniques are not sufficient to protect steganographic file systems from traffic analysis attacks. },

As long as more than 2<em>n</em>/3 parties are semi-honest, our protocol correctly computes the intersection of <em>n</em>sets, and reveals no other information than what is implied by the intersection and the secrets sets controlled by the active adversary.

Much of the focus on DBI frameworks has been on performance; little attention has been paid to their capabilities. As a result, we believe the potential of DBI has not been fully exploited.

In this paper we describe Valgrind, a DBI framework designed for building heavyweight DBA tools. We focus on its unique support for shadow values-a powerful but previously little-studied and difficult-to-implement DBA technique, which requires a tool to shadow every register and memory value with another value that describes it. This support accounts for several crucial design features that distinguish Valgrind from other DBI frameworks. Because of these features, lightweight tools built with Valgrind run comparatively slowly, but Valgrind can be used to build more interesting, heavyweight tools that are difficult or impossible to build with other DBI frameworks such as Pin and DynamoRIO.},

  abstract     = {P2P systems that rely on the voluntary contribution of bandwidth by the individual peers may suffer from free riding. To address this problem, mechanisms enforcing fairness in bandwidth sharing have been designed, usually by limiting the download bandwidth to the available upload bandwidth. As in real environments the latter is much smaller than the former, these mechanisms severely affect the download performance of most peers. In this paper we propose a system called 2Fast, which solves this problem while preserving the fairness of bandwidth sharing. In 2Fast, we form groups of peers that collaborate in downloading a file on behalf of a single group member, which can thus use its full download bandwidth. A peer in our system can use its currently idle bandwidth to help other peers in their ongoing downloads, and get in return help during its own downloads. We assess the performance of 2Fast analytically and experimentally, the latter in both real and simulated environments. We find that in realistic bandwidth limit settings, 2Fast improves the download speed by up to a factor of 3.5 in comparison to state-of-the-art P2P download protocols.},

One drawback of encrypting data, is that it can be selectively shared only at a coarse-grained level (i.e., giving another party your private key). We develop a new cryptosystem for fine-grained sharing of encrypted data that we call Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE). In our cryptosystem, ciphertexts are labeled with sets of attributes and private keys are associated with access structures that control which ciphertexts a user is able to decrypt. We demonstrate the applicability of our construction to sharing of audit-log information and broadcast encryption. Our construction supports delegation of private keys which subsumesHierarchical Identity-Based Encryption (HIBE).},

Alpha-mixing is an approach that can be added to traditional batching strategies to let senders specify for each message whether they prefer security or speed. Here we describe how to add alpha-mixing to various mix designs, and show that mix networks with this feature can provide increased anonymity for all senders in the network. Along the way we encounter subtle issues to do with the attacker{\textquoteright}s knowledge of the security parameters of the users.},

However, to justify the relevance of ad hoc networks, there have to be applications. Distributed applications require basic services such as naming. In an ad hoc network, these services have to be provided in a decentralized way. We believe that structured peer-to-peer overlays are a good basis for their design. Prior work has been focused on the long-run performance of virtual peer-to-peer overlays over ad hoc networks. In this paper, we consider a vital functionality of any peer-to-peer network: bootstrapping. We formally show that the self-configuration process of a spontaneously deployed Chord network has a time complexity linear in the network size. In addition to that, its centralized bootstrapping procedure causes an unfavorable traffic load imbalance.},

Universal Re-encryption of signatures is open to existential forgery; two-mix schemes can be fully compromised by a passive adversary observing a single message close to the sender; the fourth scheme, the rWonGoo anonymous channel, turns out to be less secure than the original Crowds scheme, on which it is based. Our attacks make extensive use of unintended {\textquotedblleft}services{\textquotedblright} provided by the network nodes acting as decryption and re-routing oracles. Finally, our attacks against rWonGoo demonstrate that anonymous channels are not automatically composable: using two of them in a careless manner makes the system more vulnerable to attack.},

MorphMix nodes incrementally construct anonymous communication tunnels based on recommendations from other nodes in the system; this P2P approach allows it to scale to millions of users. However, by allowing unknown peers to aid in tunnel construction, MorphMix is vulnerable to colluding attackers that only offer other attacking nodes in their recommendations. To avoid building corrupt tunnels, MorphMix employs a collusion detection mechanism to identify this type of misbehavior. In this paper, we challenge the assumptions of the collusion detection mechanism and demonstrate that colluding adversaries can compromise a significant fraction of all anonymous tunnels, and in some cases, a majority of all tunnels built. Our results suggest that mechanisms based solely on a node{\textquoteright}s local knowledge of the network are not sufficient to solve the difficult problem of detecting colluding adversarial behavior in a P2P system and that more sophisticated schemes may be needed.},

One essential component of these tasks is the ability to predict routes in the Internet. However, the Internet is composed of a large number of independent autonomous systems (ASes) resulting in complex interactions, and until now no model of the Internet has succeeded in producing predictions of acceptable accuracy.We demonstrate that there are two limitations of prior models: (i) they have all assumed that an Autonomous System (AS) is an atomic structure - it is not, and (ii) models have tended to oversimplify the relationships between ASes. Our approach uses multiple quasi-routers to capture route diversity within the ASes, and is deliberately agnostic regarding the types of relationships between ASes. The resulting model ensures that its routing is consistent with the observed routes. Exploiting a large number of observation points, we show that our model provides accurate predictions for unobserved routes, a first step towards developing structural mod-els of the Internet that enable real applications.},

One way to accomplish AAA in a P2P manner are de Bruijn-networks, since there data can be routed over multiple non-overlapping paths, thereby hampering malicious nodes from manipulation that data. Originally, de Bruijn-networks required a rather fixed network structure which made them unsuitable for wireless networks. In this paper we generalize de Bruijn-networks to an arbitrary number of nodes while keeping all their desired properties. This is achieved by decoupling link degree and character set of the native de Bruijn graph. Furthermore we describe how this makes the resulting network resistant against node churn.},

This landmark collection integrates these three perspectives, offering a state-of-the art survey of developments in combinatorial auction theory and practice by leaders in the field.Combinatorial auctions (CAs), by allowing bidders to express their preferences more fully, can lead to improved economic efficiency and greater auction revenues. However, challenges arise in both design and implementation. Combinatorial Auctions addresses each of these challenges. After describing and analyzing various CA mechanisms, the book addresses bidding languages and questions of efficiency. Possible strategies for solving the computationally intractable problem of how to compute the objective-maximizing allocation (known as the winner determination problem) are considered, as are questions of how to test alternative algorithms. The book discusses five important applications of CAs: spectrum auctions, airport takeoff and landing slots, procurement of freight transportation services, the London bus routes market, and industrial procurement. This unique collection makes recent work in CAs available to a broad audience of researchers and practitioners. The integration of work from the three disciplines underlying CAs, using a common language throughout, serves to advance the field in theory and practice.},

Thereby, SSR provides self-organized routing in large unstructured networks of resource-limited devices. Its ability to quickly adapt to changes in the network topology makes it suitable not only for sensor-actuator networks but also for mobile ad-hoc networks. Moreover, SSR directly provides the key-based routing semantics, thereby making it an efficient basis for the scalable implementation of self-organizing, fully decentralized applications.
In this paper we review SSR{\textquoteright}s self-organizing features and demonstrate how the combination of virtual and physical structures leads to emergence of stability and efficiency. In particular, we focus on SSR{\textquoteright}s resistance against node churn. Following the principle of combining virtual and physical structures, we propose an extension that stabilizes SSR in face of heavy node churn.

  year      = {2006},
  abstract  = {The disruptive advent of peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing in 2000 attracted significant interest. P2P networks have matured from their initial form, unstructured overlays, to structured overlays like distributed hash tables (DHTs), which are considered state-of-the-art. There are huge efforts to improve their performance. Various P2P applications like distributed storage and application-layer multicast were proposed. However, little effort was spent to understand the communication abstraction P2P overlays supply. Only when it is understood, the reach of P2P ideas will significantly broaden. Furthermore, this clarification reveals novel approaches and highlights future directions. In this paper, we reconsider well-known P2P overlays, linking them to insights from distributed systems research. We conclude that the main communication abstraction is that of a virtual address space or application-specific naming.

In this paper, we study the possibility of using anonymous communication as a building block, and show that one can leverage on anonymity in a variety of cryptographic contexts. Our results go in two directions.--Feasibility. We show that anonymous communication over insecure channels can be used to implement unconditionally secure point-to-point channels, broadcast, and generalmulti-party protocols that remain unconditionally secure as long as less than half of the players are maliciously corrupted.--Efficiency. We show that anonymous channels can yield substantial efficiency improvements for several natural secure computation tasks. In particular, we present the first solution to the problem of private information retrieval (PIR) which can handle multiple users while being close to optimal with respect to both communication and computation.A key observation that underlies these results is that local randomization of inputs, via secret-sharing, when combined with the global mixing of the shares, provided by anonymity, allows to carry out useful computations on the inputs while keeping the inputs private.

By clearly separating network participants from network nodes, two challenges of P2P networks under a Sybil attack become obvious: i) stability over time, and ii) identity differentiation. Second, as a starting point for a quantitative analysis of time-stability of P2P networks under Sybil attacks and under some assumptions with respect to identity differentiation, we propose an identity registration procedure called self-registration that makes use of the inherent distribution mechanisms of a P2P network.},

There are many such institutions; markets are the most familiar ones. Lawmakers, administrators and officers of private companies create institutions in order to achieve desired goals. They seek to do so in ways that economize on the resources needed to operate the institutions, and that provide incentives that induce the required behaviors. This book presents systematic procedures for designing mechanisms that achieve specified performance, and economize on the resources required to operate the mechanism. The systematic design procedures are algorithms for designing informationally efficient mechanisms. Most of the book deals with these procedures of design. When there are finitely many environments to be dealt with, and there is a Nash-implementing mechanism, our algorithms can be used to make that mechanism into an informationally efficient one. Informationally efficient dominant strategy implementation is also studied.

We abstract these costs with collateral keys, which grant access to customizable resources. This article introduces the notion of trace-deterring mix-networks, which encode collateral keys for every server-node into every end-to-end message trace. The network reveals no keying material when the input-to-output transitions of individual servers remain secret. Two permutation strategies for encoding key information into traces, mix-and-flip and all-or-nothing, are presented. We analyze their trade-offs with respect to computational efficiency, anonymity sets, and colluding message senders. Our techniques have sufficiently low overhead for deployment in large-scale elections, thereby providing a sort of publicly verifiable privacy guarantee.},

  abstract  = {This dissertation presents algorithms for data structures called distributed hash tables (DHT) or structured overlay networks, which are used to build scalable self-managing distributed systems. The provided algorithms guarantee lookup consistency in the presence of dynamism: they guarantee consistent lookup results in the presence of nodes joining and leaving. Similarly, the algorithms guarantee that routing never fails while nodes join and leave. Previous algorithms for lookup consistency either suffer from starvation, do not work in the presence of failures, or lack proof of correctness.
 
Several group communication algorithms for structured overlay networks are presented. We provide an overlay broadcast algorithm, which unlike previous algorithms avoids redundant messages, reaching all nodes in O(log n) time, while using O(n) messages, where n is the number of nodes in the system. The broadcast algorithm is used to build overlay multicast.
 
 
 We introduce bulk operation, which enables a node to efficiently make multiple lookups or send a message to all nodes in a specified set of identifiers. The algorithm ensures that all specified nodes are reached in O(log n) time, sending maximum O(log n) messages per node, regardless of the input size of the bulk operation. Moreover, the algorithm avoids sending redundant messages. Previous approaches required multiple lookups, which consume more messages and can render the initiator a bottleneck. Our algorithms are used in DHT-based storage systems, where nodes can do thousands of lookups to fetch large files. We use the bulk operation algorithm to construct a pseudo-reliable broadcast algorithm. Bulk operations can also be used to implement efficient range queries.
 
 
 Finally, we describe a novel way to place replicas in a DHT, called symmetric replication, that enables parallel recursive lookups. Parallel lookups are known to reduce latencies. However, costly iterative lookups have previously been used to do parallel lookups. Moreover, joins or leaves only require exchanging O(1) messages, while other schemes require at least log(f) messages for a replication degree of f.
 
The algorithms have been implemented in a middleware called the Distributed k-ary System (DKS), which is briefly described.},

  abstract     = {{Flexibility and efficiency are the prime requirements for any P2P search mechanism. Existing P2P systems do not seem to provide satisfactory solution for achieving these two conflicting goals. Unstructured search protocols (as adopted in Gnutella and FastTrack), provide search flexibility but exhibit poor performance characteristics. Structured search techniques (mostly distributed hash table (DHT)-based), on the other hand, can efficiently route queries to target peers but support exact-match queries only. In this paper we present a novel P2P system, called distributed pattern matching system (DPMS), for enabling flexible and efficient search. Distributed pattern matching can be used to solve problems like wildcard searching (for file-sharing P2P systems), partial service description matching (for service discovery systems) etc. DPMS uses a hierarchy of indexing peers for disseminating advertised patterns. Patterns are aggregated and replicated at each level along the hierarchy. Replication improves availability and resilience to peer failure, and aggregation reduces storage overhead. An advertised pattern can be discovered using any subset of its 1-bits; this allows inexact matching and queries in conjunctive normal form. Search complexity (i.e., the number of peers to be probed) in DPMS is O (log N + zetalog N/log N), where N is the total number of peers and zeta is proportional to the number of matches, required in a search result. The impact of churn problem is less severe in DPMS than DHT-based systems. Moreover, DPMS provides guarantee on search completeness for moderately stable networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPMS using mathematical analysis and simulation results}},

Malicious intermediate nodes in wireless mobile ad-hoc networks are a threat concerning security as well as anonymity of exchanged information. To protect anonymity and achieve security of nodes in mobile ad-hoc networks, an anonymous on-demand routing protocol, termed RIOMO, is proposed. For this purpose, pseudo IDs of the nodes are generated considering Pairing-based Cryptography. Nodes can generate their own pseudo IDs independently. As a result RIOMO reduces pseudo IDs maintenance costs. Only trust-worthy nodes are allowed to take part in routing to discover a route. To ensure trustiness each node has to make authentication to its neighbors through an anonymous authentication process. Thus RIOMO safely communicates between nodes without disclosing node identities; it also provides different desirable anonymous properties such as identity privacy, location privacy, route anonymity, and robustness against several attacks.},

It can therefore be beneficial to perform additional computation to reduce the number of bits transmitted. If the energy required to compress data is less than the energy required to send it, there is a net energy savings and an increase in battery life for portable computers. This article presents a study of the energy savings possible by losslessly compressing data prior to transmission. A variety of algorithms were measured on a StrongARM SA-110 processor. This work demonstrates that, with several typical compression algorithms, there is a actually a net energy increase when compression is applied before transmission. Reasons for this increase are explained and suggestions are made to avoid it. One such energy-aware suggestion is asymmetric compression, the use of one compression algorithm on the transmit side and a different algorithm for the receive path. By choosing the lowest-energy compressor and decompressor on the test platform, overall energy to send and receive data can be reduced by 11\% compared with a well-chosen symmetric pair, or up to 57\% over the default symmetric zlib scheme.},

Some well-known assumptions of traditional networks are no longer true in DTNs, which makes routing in DTNs a challenging problem. We observe that mobile nodes in realistic wireless DTNs may always have some mobility pattern information which can be used to estimate one node{\textquoteright}s ability to deliver a specific message. This estimation can greatly enhance the routing performance in DTNs. Furthermore, we adopt an alternative way to generate redundancy using erasure coding. With a fixed overhead, the erasure coding can generate a large number of message-blocks instead of a few replications, and therefore it allows the transmission of only a portion of message to a relay. This can greatly increase the routing diversity when combined with estimation-based approaches. We have conducted extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of our scheme. The results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms previously proposed schemes.},

  abstract  = {Peer-to-peer (p2p) technology can potentially be used to build highly reliable applications without a single point of failure. However, most of the existing applications, such as file sharing or web caching, have only moderate reliability demands. Without a challenging proving ground, it remains unclear whether the full potential of p2p systems can be realized.To provide such a proving ground, we have designed, deployed and operated a p2p-based email system. We chose email because users depend on it for their daily work and therefore place high demands on the availability and reliability of the service, as well as the durability, integrity, authenticity and privacy of their email. Our system, ePOST, has been actively used by a small group of participants for over two years.In this paper, we report the problems and pitfalls we encountered in this process. We were able to address some of them by applying known principles of system design, while others turned out to be novel and fundamental, requiring us to devise new solutions. Our findings can be used to guide the design of future reliable p2p systems and provide interesting new directions for future research.},

  abstract  = {Despite its popularity, relatively little is known about the traf- fic characteristics of the Skype VoIP system and how they differ from other P2P systems. We describe an experimental study of Skype VoIP traffic conducted over a one month period, where over 30 million datapoints were collected regarding the population of online clients, the number of supernodes, and their traffic characteristics. The results indicate that although the structure of the Skype system appears to be similar to other P2P systems, particularly KaZaA, there are several significant differences in traffic. The number of active clients shows diurnal and work-week behavior, correlating with normal working hours regardless of geography. The population of supernodes in the system tends to be relatively stable; thus node churn, a significant concern in other systems, seems less problematic in Skype. The typical bandwidth load on a supernode is relatively low, even if the supernode is relaying VoIP traffic. The paper aims to aid further understanding of a signifi- cant, successful P2P VoIP system, as well as provide experimental data that may be useful for design and modeling of such systems. These results also imply that the nature of a VoIP P2P system like Skype differs fundamentally from earlier P2P systems that are oriented toward file-sharing, and music and video download applications, and deserves more attention from the research community.},

  abstract     = {A P2P currency can be a powerful tool for promoting exchanges in a trusted way that make use of under-utilized resources both in computer networks and in real life. There are three classes of resource that can be exchanged in a P2P system: atoms (ex. physical goods by way of auctions), bits (ex. data files) and presences (ex. time slots for computing resources such as CPU, storage or bandwidth). If these are equally treated as commodities, however, the economy of the system is likely to collapse, because data files can be reproduced at a negligibly small cost whereas time slots for computing resources cannot even be stockpiled for future use. This paper clarifies this point by simulating a small world of traders, and proposes a novel way for applying the "reduction over time" feature[14] of i-WAT[11], a P2P currency. In the proposed new economic order (NEO), bits are freely shared among participants, whereas their producers are supported by peers, being given freedom to issue exchange tickets whose values are reduced over time.},

Unfortunately, however, it has been shown that most of today{\textquoteright}s p2p networks suffer from a large fraction of free-riders, which mostly consume resources without contributing much to the system themselves. This results in an overall performance degradation. One particularly interesting resource is bandwidth. Thereby, a service differentiation approach seems appropriate, where peers contributing higher upload bandwidth are rewarded with higher download bandwidth in return. Keeping track of the contribution of each peer in an open, decentralized environment, however, is not trivial; many systems which have been proposed are susceptible to false reports. Besides being prone to attacks, some solutions have a large communication and computation overhead, which can even be linear in the number of transactions{\textemdash}an unacceptable burden in practical and active systems. In this paper, we propose a reputation system which overcomes this scaling problem. Our analytical and simulation results are promising, indicating that the mechanism is accurate and efficient, especially when applied to systems where there are lots of transactions (e.g., due to erasure coding).},

As Tor is an overlay network, servers hosting hidden services are accessible both directly and over the anonymous channel. Traffic patterns through one channel have observable effects on the other, thus allowing a service{\textquoteright}s pseudonymous identity and IP address to be linked. One proposed solution to this vulnerability is for Tor nodes to provide fixed quality of service to each connection, regardless of other traffic, thus reducing capacity but resisting such interference attacks. However, even if each connection does not influence the others, total throughput would still affect the load on the CPU, and thus its heat output. Unfortunately for anonymity, the result of temperature on clock skew can be remotely detected through observing timestamps. This attack works because existing abstract models of anonymity-network nodes do not take into account the inevitable imperfections of the hardware they run on. Furthermore, we suggest the same technique could be exploited as a classical covert channel and can even provide geolocation.

The only prior solution to this problem, due to Damg{\r a}rd et al. [29], uses protocols that are a factor of k slower for the user and verifier, where k is the security parameter. Damg{\r a}rd et al. also only support one authentication per time period, while we support n. Because our construction is based on e-cash, we can use existing techniques to identify a cheating user, trace all of her e-tokens, and revoke her dispensers. We also offer a new anonymity service: glitch protection for basically honest users who (occasionally) reuse e-tokens. The verifier can always recognize a reused e-token; however, we preserve the anonymity of users who do not reuse e-tokens too often.

In this paper, we empirically study the performance of the key DHT operation, lookup, over Kad. First, we analytically derive the benefits of different ways to increase the richness of routing tables in Kademlia-based DHTs. Second, we empirically characterize two aspects of the accuracy of routing tables in Kad, namely completeness and freshness, and characterize their impact on Kad{\textquoteright}s lookup performance. Finally, we investigate how the efficiency and consistency of lookup in Kad can be improved by performing parallel lookup and maintaining multiple replicas, respectively.

It is especially unclear how to evaluate and improve sender anonymity, that is, untraceability of the peers who issue messages to other participants in the overlay. In a structured overlay organized as a chordal ring, we have found that a technique originally developed for recipient anonymity also improves sender anonymity. The technique is based on the use of imprecise entries in the routing tables of each participating peer. Simulations show that the sender anonymity, as measured in terms of average size of anonymity set, decreases slightly if the peers use imprecise routing; yet, the anonymity takes a better distribution, with good anonymity levels becoming more likely at the expenses of very high and very low levels. A better quality of anonymity service is thus provided to participants.},

Using simulations, we show that biased neighbor selection maintains the nearly optimal performance of Bit- Torrent in a variety of environments, and fundamentally reduces the cross-ISP traffic by eliminating the traffic{\textquoteright}s linear growth with the number of peers. Key to its performance is the rarest first piece replication algorithm used by Bit- Torrent clients. Compared with existing locality-enhancing approaches such as bandwidth limiting, gateway peers, and caching, biased neighbor selection requires no dedicated servers and scales to a large number of BitTorrent networks.},

Using BGP, autonomous systems can apply semantically rich routing policies to choose interdomain routes in a distributed fashion. This expressiveness in routing-policy choice supports domains{\textquoteright} autonomy in network operations and in business decisions, but it comes at a price: The interaction of locally defined routing policies can lead to unexpected global anomalies, including route oscillations or overall protocol divergence. Networking researchers have addressed this problem by devising constraints on policies that guarantee BGP convergence without unduly limiting expressiveness and autonomy.In addition to taking this engineering or "protocol-design" approach, researchers have approached interdomain routing from an economic or "mechanism-design" point of view. It is known that lowest-cost-path (LCP) routing can be implemented in a truthful, BGP-compatible manner but that several other natural classes of routing policies cannot. In this paper, we present a natural class of interdomain-routing policies that is more realistic than LCP routing and admits incentive-compatible, BGP-compatible implementation. We also present several positive steps toward a general theory of incentive-compatible interdomain routing.},

  abstract  = {Whoever has had his cell phone stolen knows how frustrating it is to be unable to get his contact list back. To avoid data loss when losing or destroying a mobile device like a PDA or a cell phone, data is usually backed-up to a fixed station. However, in the time between the last backup and the failure, important data can have been produced and then lost. To handle this issue, we propose a transparent collaborative backup system. Indeed, by saving data on other mobile devices between two connections to a global infrastructure, we can resist to such scenarios. In this paper, after a general description of such a system, we present a way to replicate data on mobile devices to attain a prerequired resilience for the backup.},

  abstract  = {Several fundamental security mechanisms for restricting access to network resources rely on the ability of a reference monitor to inspect the contents of traffic as it traverses the network. However, with the increasing popularity of cryptographic protocols, the traditional means of inspecting packet contents to enforce security policies is no longer a viable approach as message contents are concealed by encryption. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which common application protocols can be identified using only the features that remain intact after encryption---namely packet size, timing, and direction. We first present what we believe to be the first exploratory look at protocol identification in encrypted tunnels which carry traffic from many TCP connections simultaneously, using only post-encryption observable features. We then explore the problem of protocol identification in individual encrypted TCP connections, using much less data than in other recent approaches. The results of our evaluation show that our classifiers achieve accuracy greater than 90\% for several protocols in aggregate traffic, and, for most protocols, greater than 80\% when making fine-grained classifications on single connections. Moreover, perhaps most surprisingly, we show that one can even estimate the number of live connections in certain classes of encrypted tunnels to within, on average, better than 20\%.},

We give evidence that these techniques will exhibit the scalability necessary to be effective on the Internet. We examine several methods of actively countering the techniques, and we find that such countermeasures are effective, but at a significant increase in the size of the traffic stream.

  abstract  = {Peer-to-peer complementary currencies can be powerful tools for promoting exchanges and building sustainable relationships among selfish peers on the Internet.

i-WAT is a proposed such currency based on the WAT System, a polycentric, real-life complementary currency using WAT tickets as its media of exchange. Participants spontaneously issue and circulate the tickets as needed, whose values are backed up by chains of trust. i-WAT implements the tickets electronically by exchanging messages signed in OpenPGP.

Contributions of this research include the following:

1.Design of the total architecture of trust and fair exchange.
2.Construction, analysis and verification of the trust model of the system.
3.Construction, analysis and verification of the incentive model of the system, including reduction/multiplicatoin over time features.
4.Claim that the design of i-WAT is incentive-compatible as to protection against moral hazards, or threats caused by selfish peers because they may take advantage of the rules; such hazards are defused in i-WAT if the participants react against misbehaviors of others by pursuing their own benefits.
5.A reference implementation of i-WAT has been developed in the form of an XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol instant messaging client.

The author has managed to put the currency system into practical use since June 2004.},

  abstract  = {Scalable source routing (SSR) is a self-organizing routing protocol designed for supporting peer-to-peer applications. It is especially suited for networks that do not have a well crafted structure, e. g. ad-hoc and mesh-networks. SSR is based on the combination of source routes and a virtual ring structure. This ring is used in a Chord-like manner to obtain source routes to destinations that are not yet in the respective router cache. This approach makes SSR more message efficient than flooding based ad-hoc routing protocols. Moreover, it directly provides the semantics of a structured routing overlay. In this paper we present Linyphi, an implementation of SSR for wireless accesses routers. Linyphi combines IPv6 and SSR so that unmodified IPv6 hosts have transparent connectivity to both the Linyphi mesh network and the IPv4/v6 Internet. We give a basic outline of the implementation and demonstrate its suitability in real-world mesh network scenarios. Linyphi is available for download (www.linyphi.net).},

We present fast and cheap attacks that reveal the location of a hidden server. Using a single hostile Tor node we have located deployed hidden servers in a matter of minutes. Although we examine hidden services over Tor, our results apply to any client using a variety of anonymity networks. In fact, these are the first actual intersection attacks on any deployed public network: thus confirming general expectations from prior theory and simulation. We recommend changes to route selection design and implementation for Tor. These changes require no operational increase in network overhead and are simple to make; but they prevent the attacks we have demonstrated. They have been implemented.},

  abstract  = {We present a technique to achieve anonymous multicasting in mix networks to deliver content from producers to consumers. Employing multicast allows content producers to send (and mixes to forward) information to multiple consumers without repeating work for each individual consumer. In our approach, consumers register interest for content by creating paths in the mix network to the content{\textquoteright}s producers. When possible, these paths are merged in the network so that paths destined for the same producer share a common path suffix to the producer. When a producer sends content, the content travels this common suffix toward its consumers (in the reverse direction) and "branches" into multiple messages when necessary. We detail the design of this technique and then analyze the unlinkability of our approach against a global, passive adversary who controls both the producer and some mixes. We show that there is a subtle degradation of unlinkability that arises from multicast. We discuss techniques to tune our design to mitigate this degradation while retaining the benefits of multicast.},

  abstract     = {Many applications of mix networks such as anonymousWeb browsing require relationship anonymity: it should be hard for the attacker to determine who is communicating with whom. Conventional methods for measuring anonymity, however, focus on sender anonymity instead. Sender anonymity guarantees that it is difficult for the attacker to determine the origin of any given message exiting the mix network, but this may not be sufficient to ensure relationship anonymity. Even if the attacker cannot identify the origin of messages arriving to some destination, relationship anonymity will fail if he can determine with high probability that at least one of the messages originated from a particular sender, without necessarily being able to recognize this message among others. We give a formal definition and a calculation methodology for relationship anonymity. Our techniques are similar to those used for sender anonymity, but, unlike sender anonymity, relationship anonymity is sensitive to the distribution of message destinations. In particular, Zipfian distributions with skew values characteristic of Web browsing provide especially poor relationship anonymity. Our methodology takes route selection algorithms into account, and incorporates information-theoretic metrics such as entropy and min-entropy. We illustrate our methodology by calculating relationship anonymity in several simulated mix networks.

A high churn rate can increase costs or decrease service quality. This paper studies how to reduce churn by selecting which subset of a set of available nodes to use.First, we provide a comparison of the performance of a range of different node selection strategies in five real-world traces. Among our findings is that the simple strategy of picking a uniform-random replacement whenever a node fails performs surprisingly well. We explain its performance through analysis in a stochastic model.Second, we show that a class of strategies, which we call "Preference List" strategies, arise commonly as a result of optimizing for a metric other than churn, and produce high churn relative to more randomized strategies under realistic node failure patterns. Using this insight, we demonstrate and explain differences in performance for designs that incorporate varying degrees of randomization. We give examples from a variety of protocols, including anycast, over-lay multicast, and distributed hash tables. In many cases, simply adding some randomization can go a long way towards reducing churn.},

A mechanism for making challenges between the system{\textquoteright}s nodes ensures that this restriction is fulfilled. Furthermore, MyriadStore minimizes bandwidth requirements and migration costs by treating separately the storage of the system{\textquoteright}s meta-data and the storage of the backed up data.

In our system messages are submitted as stegotext hidden inside Usenet postings. The steganographic extraction mechanism is such that the the vast majority of the Usenet postings which do not contain keyed stegotext will produce meaningless output which serves as cover traffic, thus increasing the anonymity of the real messages. This cover traffic is subject to probabilistic attenuation in which nodes have only a small probability of distinguishing cover messages from "real" messages. This attenuation prevents cover traffic from travelling through the network in an infinite loop, while making it infeasible for an entrance node to distinguish senders.},

  abstract     = {In this work we provide efficient distributed protocols for generating shares of random noise, secure against malicious participants. The purpose of the noise generation is to create a distributed implementation of the privacy-preserving statistical databases described in recent papers [14, 4, 13]. In these databases, privacy is obtained by perturbing the true answer to a database query by the addition of a small amount of
Gaussian or exponentially distributed random noise. The computational power of even a simple form of these databases, when the query is just of the
form sum over all rows {\textquoteright}i{\textquoteright} in the database of a function
<i> f </i> applied to the data in row i, has been demonstrated in [4]. A distributed implementation eliminates the need for a trusted database administrator. The results for noise generation are of independent interest. The generation of Gaussian noise introduces a technique for distributing shares of many unbiased coins with fewer executions of verifiable secret sharing than would be needed using previous approaches (reduced by a factor of n). The generation of exponentially distributed noise uses
two shallow circuits: one for generating many arbitrarily but identically biased coins at an amortized cost of two unbiased random bits apiece, independent of the bias, and the other to combine bits of appropriate biases to obtain an exponential distribution.},

This functionality is useful in many applications, but hard to achieve when each node has only a limited, local knowledge of the whole system. We propose two generic techniques to solve this problem. The Random Tour method is based on the return time of a continuous time random walk to the node originating the query. The Sample and Collide method is based on counting the number of random samples gathered until a target number of redundant samples are obtained. It is inspired by the "birthday paradox" technique of [6], upon which it improves by achieving a target variance with fewer samples. The latter method relies on a sampling sub-routine which returns randomly chosen peers. Such a sampling algorithm is of independent interest. It can be used, for instance, for neighbour selection by new nodes joining the system. We use a continuous time random walk to obtain such samples. We analyse the complexity and accuracy of the two methods. We illustrate in particular how expansion properties of the overlay affect their performance.},

Peer to peer overlay networks are characterized by their self-organizing capabilities, resilience to failure and fully decentralized control. In a peer to peer overlay, no entity has a global knowledge of the system. As much as this property is essential to ensure the scalability, monitoring the system under such circumstances is a complex task. Yet, estimating the size of the system is core functionality for many distributed applications to parameter setting or monitoring purposes. In this paper, we propose a comparative study between three algorithms that estimate in a fully decentralized way the size of a peer to peer overlay. Candidate approaches are generally applicable irrespective of the underlying structure of the peer to peer overlay. The paper reports the head to head comparison of estimation system size algorithms. The simulations have been conducted using the same simulation framework and inputs and highlight the differences in cost and accuracy of the estimation between the algorithms both in static and dynamic settings},

In this paper, we show that this opinion is misguided.We present a thorough simulation study evaluating Chord in the well-known MANET simulator GloMoSim. We found the main issue of deploying Chord in a MANET not to be its overhead, but rather the protocol{\textquoteright}s pessimistic timeout and failover strategy. This strategy enables fast lookup resolution in spite of highly dynamic node membership, which is a significant problem in the Internet context. However, with the inherently higher packet loss rate in a MANET, this failover strategy results in lookups being inconsistently forwarded even if node membership does not change.},

In this work we address the issue of privacy preserving nearest neighbor search, which forms the kernel of many data mining applications. To this end, we present a novel algorithm based on secure multiparty computation primitives to compute the nearest neighbors of records in horizontally distributed data.

  abstract  = {SCALABLE SOURCE ROUTING is a novel routing approach for large unstructured networks, for example hybrid mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), mesh networks, or sensor-actuator networks. It is especially suited for organically growing networks of many resource-limited mobile devices supported by a few fixed-wired nodes. SCALABLE SOURCE ROUTING is a full-fledged routing protocol that directly provides the semantics of a structured peer-to-peer overlay. Hence, it can serve as an efficient basis for fully decentralized applications on mobile devices. SCALABLE SOURCE ROUTING combines source routing in the physical network with Chord-like routing in the virtual ring formed by the address space. Message forwarding greedily decreases the distance in the virtual ring while preferring physically short paths. Unlike previous approaches, scalability is achieved without imposing artificial hierarchies or assigning location-dependent addresses. SCALABLE SOURCE ROUTING enables any-to-any communication in a flat address space without maintaining any-to-any routes. Each node proactively discovers its virtual vicinity using an iterative process. Additionally, it passively caches a limited amount of additional paths. By means of extensive simulation, we show that SCALABLE SOURCE ROUTING is resource-efficient and scalable well beyond 10,000 nodes.},

To our knowledge, this is the first peer-to-peer data structure that simultaneously achieves high fault-tolerance, constant-sized nodes, and fast update and query times for ordered data. It is a non-trivial adaptation of the SkipNet/skip-graph structures of Harvey et al. and Aspnes and Shah, so as to provide fault-tolerance as these structures do, but to do so using constant-sized nodes, as in the family tree structure of Zatloukal and Harvey. It supports successor queries on a set of n items using O(log n) messages with high probability, an improvement over the expected O(log n) messages of the family tree. Our structure achieves these results by using the following new constructs:{\textbullet} Rainbow connections: parallel sets of pointers between related components of nodes, so as to achieve good connectivity between "adjacent" components, using constant-sized nodes.{\textbullet} Hydra components: highly-connected, highly fault-tolerant components of constant-sized nodes, which will contain relatively large connected subcomponents even under the failure of a constant fraction of the nodes in the component.We further augment the hydra components in the rainbow skip graph by using erasure-resilient codes to ensure that any large subcomponent of nodes in a hydra component is sufficient to reconstruct all the data stored in that component. By carefully maintaining the size of related components and hydra components to be O(log n), we are able to achieve fast times for updates and queries in the rainbow skip graph. In addition, we show how to make the communication complexity for updates and queries be worst case, at the expense of more conceptual complexity and a slight degradation in the node congestion of the data structure.},

Each output symbol is generated using O(log(1/ ε)) operations, and the original symbols are recovered from the collected ones with O(k log(1/ε)) operations.We will also introduce novel techniques for the analysis of the error probability of the decoder for finite length Raptor codes. Moreover, we will introduce and analyze systematic versions of Raptor codes, i.e., versions in which the first output elements of the coding system coincide with the original k elements.

To reduce the signalling traffic load, reactive clustering may be employed.We have developed a clustering protocol named {\textquotedblleft}On-Demand Group Mobility-Based Clustering{\textquotedblright} (ODGMBC) (2), (3) which is reactive. Its goal is to build clusters as a basis for address autoconfiguration and hierarchical routing. In contrast to the protocol described in ref. (1), the design process especially addresses the notions of group mobility and of multi-hop clusters in a MANET. As a result, ODGMBC maps varying physical node groups onto logical clusters. In this paper, ODGMBC is described. It was implemented for the ad hoc network simulator GloMoSim (4) and evaluated using several performance indicators. Simulation results are promising and show that ODGMBC leads to stable clusters. This stability is advantageous for autoconfiguration and routing mechansims to be employed in conjunction with the clustering algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Highly distributed anonymous communications systems have the promise to reduce the effectiveness of certain attacks and improve scalability over more centralized approaches. Existing approaches, however, face security and scalability issues. Requiring nodes to have full knowledge of the other nodes in the system, as in Tor and Tarzan, limits scalability and can lead to intersection attacks in peer-to-peer configurations. MorphMix avoids this requirement for complete system knowledge, but users must rely on untrusted peers to select the path. This can lead to the attacker controlling the entire path more often than is acceptable.To overcome these problems, we propose Salsa, a structured approach to organizing highly distributed anonymous communications systems for scalability and security. Salsa is designed to select nodes to be used in anonymous circuits randomly from the full set of nodes, even though each node has knowledge of only a subset of the network. It uses a distributed hash table based on hashes of the nodes{\textquoteright} IP addresses to organize the system. With a virtual tree structure, limited knowledge of other nodes is enough to route node lookups throughout the system. We use redundancy and bounds checking when performing lookups to prevent malicious nodes from returning false information without detection. We show that our scheme prevents attackers from biasing path selection, while incurring moderate overheads, as long as the fraction of malicious nodes is less than 20\%. Additionally, the system prevents attackers from obtaining a snapshot of the entire system until the number of attackers grows too large (e.g. 15\% for 10000 peers and 256 groups). The number of groups can be used as a tunable parameter in the system, depending on the number of peers, that can be used to balance performance and security.},

  abstract  = {Routing in wireless networks is inherently difficult since their network topologies are typically unstructured and unstable. Therefore, many routing protocols for ad-hoc networks and sensor networks revert to flooding to acquire routes to previously unknown destinations. However, such an approach does not scale to large networks, especially when nodes need to communicate with many different destinations. This paper advocates a novel approach, the scalable source routing (SSR) protocol. It combines overlay-like routing in a virtual network structure with source routing in the physical network structure. As a consequence, SSR can efficiently provide the routing semantics of a structured routing overlay, making it an efficient basis for the scalable implementation of fully decentralized applications. In T. Fuhrmann (2005) it has been demonstrated that SSR can almost entirely avoid flooding, thus leading to a both memory and message efficient routing mechanism for large unstructured networks. This paper extends SSR to unstable networks, i. e. networks with churn where nodes frequently join and leave, the latter potentially ungracefully},

This paper uses techniques from Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) to develop {\textquotedblleft}secure protocols{\textquotedblright} for the CPFR (Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment) business process. The result is a process that permits supply-chain partners to capture all of the benefits of information-sharing and collaborative decision-making, but without disclosing their {\textquotedblleft}private{\textquotedblright} demandsignal (e.g., promotions) and cost information to one another. In our collaborative CPFR) scenario, the retailer and supplier engage in SMC protocols that result in: (1) a forecast that uses both the retailers and the suppliers observed demand signals to better forecast demand; and (2) prescribed order/shipment quantities based on system-wide costs and inventory levels (and on the joint forecasts) that minimize supply-chain expected cost/period. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we demonstrate that CPFR can be securely implemented without disclosing the private information of either partner; (2) we show that the CPFR business process is not incentive compatible without transfer payments and develop an incentive-compatible linear transfer-payment scheme for
collaborative forecasting; (3) we demonstrate that our protocols are not only secure (i.e., privacy preserving), but that neither partner is able to make accurate inferences about the others future demand signals from the outputs of the protocols; and (4) we illustrate the benefits of secure collaboration using simulation.

  abstract  = {Individuals are increasingly confronted with requests to identify themselves when accessing services provided by government organizations, companies, and other service providers. At the same time, traditional transaction mechanisms are increasingly being replaced by electronic mechanisms that underneath their hood automatically capture and record globally unique identifiers. Taken together, these interrelated trends are currently eroding the privacy and security of individuals in a manner unimaginable just a few decades ago. Privacy activists are facing an increasingly hopeless battle against new privacy-invasive identification initiatives: the cost of computerized identification systems is rapidly going down, their accuracy and efficiency is improving all the time, much of the required data communication infrastructure is now in place, forgery of non-electronic user credentials is getting easier all the time, and data sharing imperatives have gone up dramatically. This paper argues that the privacy vs. identification debate should be moved into less polarized territory. Contrary to popular misbelief, identification and privacy are not opposite interests that need to be balanced: the same technological advances that threaten to annihilate privacy can be exploited to save privacy in an electronic age. The aim of this paper is to clarify that premise on the basis of a careful analysis of the concept of user identification itself. Following an examination of user identifiers and its purposes, I classify identification technologies in a manner that enables their privacy and security implications to be clearly articulated and contrasted. I also include an overview of a modern privacy-preserving approach to user identification.},

Thereby, it can provide indirect routing in networks that lack a well-crafted structure. SSR is well suited for mobile ad hoc networks, sensor-actuator networks, and especially for mesh networks. Moreover, SSR directly provides the routing semantics of a structured routing overlay, making it an efficient basis for the scalable implementation of fully decentralized applications. In this paper we analyze SSR with regard to security: We show where SSR is prone to attacks, and we describe protocol modifications that make SSR robust in the presence of malicious nodes. The core idea is to introduce cryptographic certificates that allow nodes to discover forged protocol messages. We evaluate our proposed modifications by means of simulations, and thus demonstrate that they are both effective and efficient.},

This paper presents SybilGuard, a novel protocol for limiting the corruptive influences of sybil attacks.Our protocol is based on the "social network "among user identities, where an edge between two identities indicates a human-established trust relationship. Malicious users can create many identities but few trust relationships. Thus, there is a disproportionately-small "cut" in the graph between the sybil nodes and the honest nodes.

This result immediately implies solutions to other long-standing open problems such as constant-rounds and unconditionally secure protocols for deciding whether a shared number is zero, comparing shared numbers, raising a shared number to a shared exponent and reducing a shared number modulo a shared modulus.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of peer participation, or churn, are an inherent property of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems and critical for design and evaluation. Accurately characterizing churn requires precise and unbiased information about the arrival and departure of peers, which is challenging to acquire. Prior studies show that peer participation is highly dynamic but with conflicting characteristics. Therefore, churn remains poorly understood, despite its significance.In this paper, we identify several common pitfalls that lead to measurement error. We carefully address these difficulties and present a detailed study using three widely-deployed P2P systems: an unstructured file-sharing system (Gnutella), a content-distribution system (BitTorrent), and a Distributed Hash Table (Kad). Our analysis reveals several properties of churn: (i) overall dynamics are surprisingly similar across different systems, (ii) session lengths are not exponential, (iii) a large portion of active peers are highly stable while the remaining peers turn over quickly, and (iv) peer session lengths across consecutive appearances are correlated. In summary, this paper advances our understanding of churn by improving accuracy, comparing different P2P file sharingdistribution systems, and exploring new aspects of churn.},

  abstract     = {Location hidden services have received increasing attention as a means to resist censorship and protect the identity of service operators. Research and vulnerability analysis to date has mainly focused on how to locate the hidden service. But while the hiding techniques have improved, almost no progress has been made in increasing the resistance against DoS attacks directly or indirectly on hidden services. In this paper we suggest improvements that should be easy to adopt within the existing hidden service design, improvements that will both reduce vulnerability to DoS attacks and add QoS as a service option. In addition we show how to hide not just the location but the existence of the hidden service from everyone but the users knowing its service address. Not even the public directory servers will know how a private hidden service can be contacted, or know it exists.

Such environments can be found for example in very sparse mobile networks where nodes {\textquotedblright}meet {\textquotedblright} only occasionally and are able to exchange information, or in wireless sensor networks where nodes sleep most of the time to conserve energy. Forwarding mechanisms in such networks usually resort to some form of intelligent flooding, as for example in probabilistic routing. We propose a communication algorithm that significantly reduces the overhead of probabilistic routing algorithms, making it a suitable building block for a delay-tolerant network architecture. Our forwarding scheme is based on network coding. Nodes do not simply forward packets they overhear but may send out information that is coded over the contents of several packets they received. We show by simulation that this algorithm achieves the reliability and robustness of flooding at a small fraction of the overhead.},

We analyze the anonymity of this technique when an adversary can learn the output positions of some of the inputs to the mix network. Using probabilistic modeling, we show that parallel mixing falls short of achieving optimal anonymity in this case. In particular, when the number of unknown inputs is small, there are significant anonymity losses in the expected case. This remains true even if all the mixes in the network are honest, and becomes worse as the number of mixes increases. We also consider repeatedly applying parallel mixing to the same set of inputs. We show that an attacker who knows some input{\textendash}output relationships will learn new information with each mixing and can eventually link previously unknown inputs and outputs.},

  abstract     = {This paper evaluates the ability of a wireless mesh architecture to provide high performance Internet access while demanding little deployment planning or operational management. The architecture considered in this paper has unplanned node placement (rather than planned topology), omni-directional antennas (rather than directional links), and multi-hop routing (rather than single-hop base stations). These design decisions contribute to ease of deployment, an important requirement for community wireless networks. However, this architecture carries the risk that lack of planning might render the network{\textquoteright}s performance unusably low. For example, it might be necessary to place nodes carefully to ensure connectivity; the omni-directional antennas might provide uselessly short radio ranges; or the inefficiency of multi-hop forwarding might leave some users effectively disconnected.The paper evaluates this unplanned mesh architecture with a case study of the Roofnet 802.11b mesh network. Roofnet consists of 37 nodes spread over four square kilometers of an urban area. The network provides users with usable performance despite lack of planning: the average inter-node throughput is 627 kbits/second, even though the average route has three hops.The paper evaluates multiple aspects of the architecture: the effect of node density on connectivity and throughput; the characteristics of the links that the routing protocol elects to use; the usefulness of the highly connected mesh afforded by omni-directional antennas for robustness and throughput; and the potential performance of a single-hop network using the same nodes as Roofnet.

In such environments, protocols must tolerate both Byzantine behaviors when broken, misconfigured, or malicious nodes arbitrarily deviate from their specification and rational behaviors when selfish nodes deviate from their specification to increase their local benefit. The paper makes three contributions: (1) It introduces the BAR (Byzantine, Altruistic, Rational) model as a foundation for reasoning about cooperative services; (2) It proposes a general three-level architecture to reduce the complexity of building services under the BAR model; and (3) It describes an implementation of BAR-B the first cooperative backup service to tolerate both Byzantine users and an unbounded number of rational users. At the core of BAR-B is an asynchronous replicated state machine that provides the customary safety and liveness guarantees despite nodes exhibiting both Byzantine and rational behaviors. Our prototype provides acceptable performance for our application: our BAR-tolerant state machine executes 15 requests per second, and our BAR-B backup service can back up 100MB of data in under 4 minutes.},

Some previous works have been done to build a replica location mechanism, but they are not suitable for replica location in a grid environment with multiple applications like ChinaGrid.

In this paper, we propose Cashmere, a resilient anonymous routing layer built on a structured peer-to-peer overlay. Instead of single-node mixes, Cashmere selects regions in the overlay namespace as mixes. Any node in a region can act as the MIX, drastically reducing the probability of a mix failure.

The success of these approaches, however, depend on how NAT boxes respond to various sequences of TCP (and ICMP) packets. This paper presents the first broad study of NAT behavior for a comprehensive set of TCP NAT traversal techniques over a wide range of commercial NAT products. We developed a publicly available software test suite that measures the NAT{\textquoteright}s responses both to a variety of isolated probes and to complete TCP connection establishments. We test sixteen NAT products in the lab, and 93 home NATs in the wild. Using these results, as well as market data for NAT products, we estimate the likelihood of successful NAT traversal for home networks. The insights gained from this paper can be used to guide both design of TCP NAT traversal protocols and the standardization of NAT/firewall behavior, including the IPv4-IPv6 translating NATs critical for IPv6 transition.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents efficient off-line anonymous e-cash schemes where a user can withdraw a wallet containing 2^l coins each of which she can spend unlinkably. Our first result is a scheme, secure under the strong RSA and the y-DDHI assumptions, where the complexity of the withdrawal and spend operations is O(l+k) and the user{\textquoteright}s wallet can be stored using O(l+k) bits, where k is a security parameter. The best previously known schemes require at least one of these complexities to be O(2^l k). In fact, compared to previous e-cash schemes, our whole wallet of 2^l coins has about the same size as one coin in these schemes. Our scheme also offers exculpability of users, that is, the bank can prove to third parties that a user has double-spent.

We then extend our scheme to our second result, the first e-cash scheme that provides traceable coins without a trusted third party. That is, once a user has double spent one of the 2^l coins in her wallet, all her spendings of these coins can be traced. We present two alternate constructions. One construction shares the same complexities with our first result but requires a strong bilinear map assumption that is only conjectured to hold on MNT curves. The second construction works on more general types of elliptic curves, but the price for this is that the complexity of the spending and of the withdrawal protocols becomes O(lk) and O(lk + k^2) bits, respectively, and wallets take O(lk) bits of storage. All our schemes are secure in the random oracle model.},

Models based on subgame perfection find that the information necessary to support cooperation is recursive in nature and thus information generating and processing requirements are quite demanding. Models that do not rely on subgame perfection, on the other hand, suggest that the information demands may be quite modest. The experiment we present indicates that even without any reputation information there is a non-negligible amount of cooperation that is, however, quite sensitive to the cooperation costs. For high costs, providing information about a partner{\textquoteright}s immediate past action increases cooperation. Recursive information about the partners{\textquoteright} previous partners{\textquoteright} reputation further promotes cooperation, regardless of the cooperation costs.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the study of peer-to-peer file swarming systems {\`a} la BitTorrent, we introduce a probabilistic model of coupon replication systems. These systems consist of users, aiming to complete a collection of distinct coupons. Users are characterised by their current collection of coupons, and leave the system once they complete their coupon collection. The system evolution is then specified by describing how users of distinct types meet, and which coupons get replicated upon such encounters.For open systems, with exogenous user arrivals, we derive necessary and sufficient stability conditions in a layered scenario, where encounters are between users holding the same number of coupons. We also consider a system where encounters are between users chosen uniformly at random from the whole population. We show that performance, captured by sojourn time, is asymptotically optimal in both systems as the number of coupon types becomes large.We also consider closed systems with no exogenous user arrivals. In a special scenario where users have only one missing coupon, we evaluate the size of the population ultimately remaining in the system, as the initial number of users, N, goes to infinity. We show that this decreases geometrically with the number of coupons, K. In particular, when the ratio K/log(N) is above a critical threshold, we prove that this number of left-overs is of order log(log(N)).These results suggest that performance of file swarming systems does not depend critically on either altruistic user behavior, or on load balancing strategies such as rarest first.},

We present two new decentralized algorithms for estimation in dynamic groups, analyze the algorithms, and experimentally evaluate them using real-life traces. One scheme is active: it spreads a gossip into the overlay first, and then samples the receipt times of this gossip at different processes. The second scheme is passive: it measures the density of processes when their identifiers are hashed into a real interval. Both schemes have low latency, scalable perprocess overheads, and provide high levels of probabilistic accuracy for the estimate. They are implemented as part of a size estimation utility called PeerCounter that can be incorporated modularly into standard peer-to-peer overlays. We present experimental results from both the simulations and PeerCounter, running on a cluster of 33 Linux servers.},

Network operators in each AS configure BGP routers to control the routes that are learned, selected, and announced to other routers. Faults in BGP configuration can cause forwarding loops, packet loss, and unintended paths between hosts, each of which constitutes a failure of the Internet routing infrastructure.

This paper describes the design and implementation of rcc, the router configuration checker, a tool that finds faults in BGP configurations using static analysis. rcc detects faults by checking constraints that are based on a high-level correctness specification. rcc detects two broad classes of faults: route validity faults, where routers may learn routes that do not correspond to usable paths, and path visibility faults, where routers may fail to learn routes for paths that exist in the network. rcc enables network operators to test and debug configurations before deploying them in an operational network, improving on the status quo where most faults are detected only during operation. rcc has been downloaded by more than sixty-five network operators to date, some of whom have shared their configurations with us. We analyze network-wide configurations from 17 different ASes to detect a wide variety of faults and use these findings to motivate improvements to the Internet routing infrastructure.},

In particular, we consider a P2P file sharing system in which when a peer downloads the file it is required to serve the file to upto N other peers within a maximum period of time T. We study the behavior of this contribution scheme in both centralized and decentralized P2P networks. In a centralized architecture, new requests are forwarded to a central server which hands out the contract along with a list of peers from where the file can be downloaded. We show that a simple fixed contract (i.e., fixed values of N and T) is sufficient to create the required server capacity which adapts to the load. Furthermore, we show that T, the time part of the contract is a more important control parameter than N. In the case of a decentralized P2P architecture, each new request is broadcast to a certain neighborhood determined by the time-to-live (TTL) parameter. Each server receiving the request independently doles out a contract and the requesting peer chooses the one which is least constraining. If there are no servers in the neighborhood, the request fails. To achieve a good request success ratio, we propose an adaptive scheme to set the contracts without requiring global information. Through both analysis and simulation, we show that the proposed scheme adapts to the load and achieves low request failure rate with high server efficiency.},

Current approaches are primarily based on redundant transmissions. They have either high overhead due to excessive transmissions or long delays due to the possibility of making wrong choices when forwarding a few redundant copies. In this paper, we propose a novel forwarding algorithm based on the idea of erasure codes. Erasure coding allows use of a large number of relays while maintaining a constant overhead, which results in fewer cases of long delays. We use simulation to compare the routing performance of using erasure codes in DTN with four other categories of forwarding algorithms proposed in the literature. Our simulations are based on a real-world mobility trace collected in a large outdoor wild-life environment. The results show that the erasure-coding based algorithm provides the best worst-case delay performance with a fixed amount of overhead. We also present a simple analytical model to capture the delay characteristics of erasure-coding based forwarding, which provides insights on the potential of our approach.},

We propose exchange-based mechanisms that provide incentives for cooperation in peer-to-peer file sharing networks. Peers give higher service priority to requests from peers that can provide a simultaneous and symmetric service in return. We generalize this approach to n-way exchanges among rings of peers and present a search algorithm for locating such rings. We have used simulation to analyze the effect of exchanges on performance. Our results show that exchange-based mechanisms can provide strong incentives for sharing, offering significant improvements in service times for sharing users compared to free-riders, without the problems and complexity of cash- or credit-based systems.},

Our mechanism leads to allocations that simultaneously optimize throughput and fairness criteria. We analyze the performance of our mechanism in terms of the induced Nash equilibrium. We compare the allocations at the Nash equilibrium with throughput-optimal allocations as well as with fairness-optimal allocations. Our mechanism offers a smooth trade-off between these criteria, and allows us to produce allocations that are approximately optimal with respect to both. Our mechanism is also fairly simple and admits an efficient distributed implementation.},

  abstract  = {As the ubiquitous computing vision materializes, the number and diversity of digital elements in our environment increases. Computing capability comes in various forms and is embedded in different physical objects, ranging from miniature devices such as human implants and tiny sensor particles, to large constructions such as vehicles and entire buildings. The number of possible interactions among such elements, some of which may be invisible or offer similar functionality, is growing fast so that it becomes increasingly hard to combine or select between them. Mechanisms are thus required for intelligent matchmaking that will achieve controlled system behavior, yet without requiring the user to continuously input desirable options in an explicit manner. In this paper we argue that information about the colocation relationship of computing elements is quite valuable in this respect and can be exploited to guide automated service selection with minimal or no user involvement. We also discuss the implementation of such mechanism that is part of our runtime system for smart objects.},

Other than traditional networks Peer-to-Peer networks do not rely on a specific infrastructure offering transport services. Instead they form {\textquotedblleft}overlay structures{\textquotedblright} focusing on content allocation and distribution based on TCP or HTTP connections. Whereas in a standard Client-Server configuration content is stored and provided only via some central server(s), Peer-to-Peer networks are highly decentralized and locate a desired content at some participating peer and provide the corresponding IP address of that peer to the searching peer. The download of that content is then initiated using a separate connection, often using HTTP. Thus, the high load usually resulting for a central server and its surrounding network is avoided leading to a more even distribution of load on the underlying physical network. On the other hand, such networks are typically subject to frequent changes because peers join and leave the network without any central control.},

We provide a formal definition of onion-routing in the universally composable framework, and also discover a simpler definition (similar to CCA2 security for encryption) that implies security in the UC framework. We then exhibit an efficient and easy to implement construction of an onion routing scheme satisfying this definition.},

A Fuzzy IBE scheme allows for a private key for an identity, ω, to decrypt a ciphertext encrypted with an identity, ω , if and only if the identities ω and ω are close to each other as measured by the {\textquotedblleft}set overlap{\textquotedblright} distance metric. A Fuzzy IBE scheme can be applied to enable encryption
using biometric inputs as identities; the error-tolerance property of a Fuzzy IBE scheme is precisely what allows for the use of biometric identities, which inherently will have some noise each time they are sampled. Additionally, we show that Fuzzy-IBE can be used for a type of application that we term {\textquotedblleft}attribute-based encryption{\textquotedblright}.
In this paper we present two constructions of Fuzzy IBE schemes. Our constructions can be viewed as an Identity-Based Encryption of a message under several attributes that compose a (fuzzy) identity. Our IBE schemes are both error-tolerant and secure against collusion attacks. Additionally, our basic construction does not use random oracles. We prove the security of our schemes under the Selective-ID security model.

  abstract  = {As computer networks increase in size, become more heterogeneous and span greater geographic distances, applications must be designed to cope with the very large scale, poor reliability, and often, with the extreme dynamism of the underlying network. Aggregation is a key functional building block for such applications: it refers to a set of functions that provide components of a distributed system access to global information including network size, average load, average uptime, location and description of hotspots, and so on. Local access to global information is often very useful, if not indispensable for building applications that are robust and adaptive. For example, in an industrial control application, some aggregate value reaching a threshold may trigger the execution of certain actions; a distributed storage system will want to know the total available free space; load-balancing protocols may benefit from knowing the target average load so as to minimize the load they transfer. We propose a gossip-based protocol for computing aggregate values over network components in a fully decentralized fashion. The class of aggregate functions we can compute is very broad and includes many useful special cases such as counting, averages, sums, products, and extremal values. The protocol is suitable for extremely large and highly dynamic systems due to its proactive structure---all nodes receive the aggregate value continuously, thus being able to track any changes in the system. The protocol is also extremely lightweight, making it suitable for many distributed applications including peer-to-peer and grid computing systems. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our gossip-based protocol both theoretically and experimentally under a variety of scenarios including node and communication failures.},

Therefore, in the absence of incentives to the contrary, rational (i.e., selfish) intermediate nodes may choose to forward packets at a low priority or simply not forward packets at all. Using a principal-agent model, we show how the hidden-action problem can be overcome through appropriate design of contracts, in both the direct (the endpoints contract with each individual router) and recursive (each router contracts with the next downstream router) cases. We further demonstrate that per-hop monitoring does not necessarily improve the utility of the principal or the social welfare in the system. In addition, we generalize existing mechanisms that deal with hidden-information to handle scenarios involving both hidden-information and hidden-action.},

However the FEC performances are also largely dependent on the packet scheduling used during transmission and on the loss pattern introduced by the channel. Little attention has been devoted to these aspects so far. Therefore the present paper analyzes their impacts on the three FEC codes: LDGM Staircase, LDGM Triangle, two large block codes, and Reed-Solomon. Thanks to this analysis, we define several recommendations on how to best use these codes, depending on the test case and on the channel, which turns out to be of utmost importance.},

Based on these guidelines, we propose a new, simple incentive mechanism. Our analysis and the experimental results using PlanetLab show that the original incentive mechanism of BitTorrent can induce free riding because it is not effective in rewarding and punishing downloaders properly. In contrast, a new mechanism proposed by us is shown to be more robust against free riders.},

These overlays generally assume node connectivity to be provided by an underlying network-layer routing protocol. This duplication of functionality can give rise to severe inefficiencies. In contrast, we suggest a cross-layer approach where the P2P overlay network also provides the required network-layer routing functionality by itself. Especially in sensor networks, where special attention has to be paid to the nodes{\textquoteright} limited capabilities, this can greatly help in reducing the message overhead. In this paper, we present a key building block for such a protocol, the iterative successor pointer rewiring protocol (ISPRP), which efficiently initializes a P2P routing network among a freshly deployed set of nodes having but link-layer connectivity. ISPRP works in a fully self-organizing way and issues only a small per-node amount of messages by keeping interactions between nodes as local as possible.},

Our results indicate that systems with heavy-tailed lifetime distributions are more resilient than those with light-tailed (e.g., exponential) distributions and that for a given average degree, k-regular graphs exhibit the highest resilience. As a practical illustration of our results, each user in a system with n = 100 billion peers, 30-minute average lifetime, and 1-minute node-replacement delay can stay connected to the graph with probability 1 - 1 n using only 9 neighbors. This is in contrast to 37 neighbors required under previous modeling efforts. We finish the paper by showing that many P2P networks are almost surely (i.e., with probability 1-o(1)) connected if they have no isolated nodes and derive a simple model for the probability that a P2P system partitions under churn.},

  abstract     = {We consider anonymous communication protocols based on onions: each message is sent in an encrypted form through a path chosen at random by its sender, and the message is re-coded by each server on the path. Recently, it has been shown that if the anonymous paths are long enough, then the protocols provide provable security for some adversary models. However, it was assumed that all users choose intermediate servers uniformly at random from the same set of servers.
We show that if a single user chooses only from a constrained subset of possible intermediate servers, anonymity level may dramatically decrease. A thumb rule is that if Alice is aware of much less than 50\% of possible intermediate servers, then the anonymity set for her message becomes surprisingly small with high probability. Moreover, for each location in the anonymity set an adversary may compute probability that it gets a message of Alice. Since there are big differences in these probabilities, in most cases the true destination of the message from Alice is in a small group of locations with the highest probabilities.
Our results contradict some beliefs that the protocols mentioned guarantee anonymity provided that the set of possible intermediate servers for each user is large.},

  abstract  = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing has emerged as a popular model aiming at further utilizing Internet information and resources. However, the mechanism of peers randomly choosing logical neighbors without any knowledge about underlying physical topology can cause a serious topology mismatch between the P2P overlay network and the physical underlying network. The topology mismatch problem brings great stress in the Internet infrastructure. It greatly limits the performance gain from various search or routing techniques. Meanwhile, due to the inefficient overlay topology, the flooding-based search mechanisms cause a large volume of unnecessary traffic. Aiming at alleviating the mismatching problem and reducing the unnecessary traffic, we propose a location-aware topology matching (LTM) technique. LTM builds an efficient overlay by disconnecting slow connections and choosing physically closer nodes as logical neighbors while still retaining the search scope and reducing response time for queries. LTM is scalable and completely distributed in the sense that it does not require any global knowledge of the whole overlay network. The effectiveness of LTM is demonstrated through simulation studies.},

  abstract     = {Tor is the second generation Onion Router, supporting the anonymous transport of TCP streams over the Internet. Its low latency makes it very suitable for common tasks, such as web browsing, but insecure against traffic-analysis attacks by a global passive adversary. We present new traffic-analysis techniques that allow adversaries with only a partial view of the network to infer which nodes are being used to relay the anonymous streams and therefore greatly reduce the anonymity provided by Tor. Furthermore, we show that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator. Our attack is feasible for the adversary anticipated by the Tor designers. Our theoretical attacks are backed up by experiments performed on the deployed, albeit experimental, Tor network. Our techniques should also be applicable to any low latency anonymous network. These attacks highlight the relationship between the field of traffic-analysis and more traditional computer security issues, such as covert channel analysis. Our research also highlights that the inability to directly observe network links does not prevent an attacker from performing traffic-analysis: the adversary can use the anonymising network as an oracle to infer the traffic load on remote nodes in order to perform traffic-analysis.},

  abstract     = {Selfish overlay networks consist of autonomous nodes that develop their own strategies by optimizing towards their local objectives and self-interests, rather than following prescribed protocols. It is thus important to regulate the behavior of selfish nodes, so that system-wide properties are optimized. In this paper, we investigate the problem of bandwidth allocation in overlay networks, and propose to use a market-driven approach to regulate the behavior of selfish nodes that either provide or consume services. In such markets, consumers of services select the best service providers, taking into account both the performance and the price of the service. On the other hand, service providers are encouraged to strategically decide their respective prices in a pricing game, in order to maximize their economic revenues and minimize losses in the long run. In order to overcome the limitations of previous models towards similar objectives, we design a decentralized algorithm that uses reinforcement learning to help selfish nodes to incrementally adapt to the local market, and to make optimized strategic decisions based on past experiences. We have simulated our proposed algorithm in randomly generated overlay networks, and have shown that the behavior of selfish nodes converges to their optimal strategies, and resource allocations in the entire overlay are near-optimal, and efficiently adapts to the dynamics of overlay networks.},

  abstract     = {Existing studies on BitTorrent systems are single-torrent based, while more than 85\% of all peers participate in multiple torrents according to our trace analysis. In addition, these studies are not sufficiently insightful and accurate even for single-torrent models, due to some unrealistic assumptions. Our analysis of representative Bit-Torrent traffic provides several new findings regarding the limitations of BitTorrent systems: (1) Due to the exponentially decreasing peer arrival rate in reality, service availability in such systems becomes poor quickly, after which it is difficult for the file to be located and downloaded. (2) Client performance in the BitTorrent-like systems is unstable, and fluctuates widely with the peer population. (3) Existing systems could provide unfair services to peers, where peers with high downloading speed tend to download more and upload less. In this paper, we study these limitations on torrent evolution in realistic environments. Motivated by the analysis and modeling results, we further build a graph based multi-torrent model to study inter-torrent collaboration. Our model quantitatively provides strong motivation for inter-torrent collaboration instead of directly stimulating seeds to stay longer. We also discuss a system design to show the feasibility of multi-torrent collaboration.},

In order to rationally design such applications, it is important to know (and understand) the properties of the overlay networks as seen from the respective application.
This paper reports the results from a two week measurement of the entire Overnet network, the currently most widely deployed DHT-based overlay. We describe both, the design choices that made that measurement feasible and the results from the measurement itself.

With network coding, each node of the distribution network is able to generate and transmit encoded blocks of information. The randomization introduced by the coding process eases the scheduling of block propagation, and, thus, makes the distribution more efficient. This is particularly important in large unstructured overlay networks, where the nodes need to make block forwarding decisions based on local information only. We compare network coding to other schemes that transmit unencoded information (i.e. blocks of the original file) and, also, to schemes in which only the source is allowed to generate and transmit encoded packets. We study the performance of network coding in heterogeneous networks with dynamic node arrival and departure patterns, clustered topologies, and when incentive mechanisms to discourage free-riding are in place. We demonstrate through simulations of scenarios of practical interest that the expected file download time improves by more than 20-30\% with network coding compared to coding at the server only and, by more than 2-3 times compared to sending unencoded information. Moreover, we show that network coding improves the robustness of the system and is able to smoothly handle extreme situations where the server and nodes leave the system.},

Selfish users may have a tendency to misrepresent preferences -- so as to minimize individual contributions -- leading to inefficient levels of production of the resource. Groves and Loeb formulated a classic model capturing this problem, and proposed (what later came to be known as) the VCG mechanism as a solution. However, in the presence of heterogeneous users and communication constraints, or in decentralized settings, implementing this mechanism places an unrealistic communication burden. In this paper we propose a class of alternative mechanisms for the same problem as considered by Groves and Loeb, but with the added constraint of severely limited communication between users and the provisioning authority. When these mechanisms are used, efficient production is ensured as a Nash equilibrium outcome, for a broad class of users. Furthermore, a natural bid update strategy is shown to globally converge to efficient Nash equilibria. An extension to multiple public goods with inter-related valuations is also presented.},

For applications that require verifiability, each trustee provides a proof of correct mixing. Though mixnets have recently been made quite e$\#$cient, they still require secret computation and proof generation after the mixing process.

We introduce and implement Obfuscated Ciphertext Mixing, the obfuscation of a mixnet program. Using this technique, all proofs can be performed before the mixing process, even before the inputs are available. In addition, the mixing program does not need to be secret: anyone can publicly compute the shuffle (though not the decryption). We frame this functionality in the strongest obfuscation setting proposed by Barak et. al. [4], tweaked for the public-key setting. For applications where the secrecy of the shuffle permutation is particularly important (e.g. voting), we also consider the Distributed Obfuscation of a Mixer, where multiple trustees cooperate to generate an obfuscated mixer program such that no single trustee knows the composed shuffle permutation.},

To enforce this balance, some kind of currency or barter (called karma) is needed that must be exchanged for resources thus limiting abuse. We present a completely decentralised, off-line karma implementation for P2P and grid systems, that detects double-spending and other types of fraud under varying adversarial scenarios. The system is based on tracing the spending pattern of coins, and distributing the normally central role of a bank over a predetermined, but random, selection of nodes. The system is designed to allow nodes to join and leave the system at arbitrary times.},

  abstract  = {A crucial aspect of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems is that of providing incentives for users to contribute their resources to the system. Without such incentives, empirical data show that a majority of the participants act asfree riders. As a result, a substantial amount of resource goes untapped, and, frequently, P2P systems devolve into client-server systems with attendant issues of performance under high load. We propose to address the free rider problem by introducing the notion of a P2P contract. In it, peers are made aware of the benefits they receive from the system as a function of their contributions. In this paper, we first describe a utility-based framework to determine the components of the contract and formulate the associated resource allocation problem. We consider the resource allocation problem for a flash crowd scenario and show how the contract mechanism implemented using a centralized server can be used to quickly create pseudoservers that can serve out the requests. We then study a decentralized implementation of the P2P contract scheme in which each node implements the contract based on local demand. We show that in such a system, other than contributing storage and bandwidth to serve out requests, it is also important that peer nodes function as application-level routers to connect pools of available pseudoservers. We study the performance of the distributed implementation with respect to the various parameters including the terms of the contract and the triggers to create pseudoservers and routers.},

All data are stored using the Past distributed hash table (DHT), which we have modified in order to reduce the number of network messages it generates, thus optimizing replica retrieval.
Pastis{\textquoteright} design is simple compared to other existing systems, as it does not require complex algorithms like Byzantine-fault tolerant (BFT) replication or a central administrative authority. It is also highly scalable in terms of the number of network nodes and users sharing a given file or portion of the file system. Furthermore, Pastis takes advantage of the fault tolerance and good locality properties of its underlying storage layer, the Past DHT.
We have developed a prototype based on the FreePastry open-source implementation of the Past DHT. We have used this prototype to evaluate several characteristics of our file system design. Supporting the close-to-open consistency model, plus a variant of the read-your-writes model, our prototype shows that Pastis is between 1.4 to 1.8 times slower than NFS. In comparison, Ivy and Oceanstore are between two to three times slower than NFS.},

This paper documents and analyzes one of the simplest but most robust and practical NAT traversal techniques, commonly known as hole punching. Hole punching is moderately well-understood for UDP communication, but we show how it can be reliably used to set up peer-to-peer TCP streams as well. After gathering data on the reliability of this technique on a wide variety of deployed NATs, we nd that about 82\% of the NATs tested support hole punching for UDP, and about 64\% support hole punching for TCP streams. As NAT vendors become increasingly conscious of the needs of important P2P applications such as Voice over IP and online gaming protocols, support for hole punching is likely to increase in the future.},

This paper reports on a study in which (1) user concerns were analysed more deeply and (2) what users said was contrasted with what they did in an experimental e-commerce scenario. Eleven independent variables were shown to affect the online behavior of at least some groups of users. Most significant were trust marks present on web pages and the existence of a privacy policy, though users seldom consulted the policy when one existed. We also find that many users have inaccurate perceptions of their own knowledge about privacy technology and vulnerabilities, and that important user groups, like those similar to the Westin "privacy fundamentalists", do not appear to form a cohesive group for privacy-related decision making.In this study we adopt an experimental economic research paradigm, a method for examining user behavior which challenges the current emphasis on survey data. We discuss these issues and the implications of our results on user interpretation of trust marks and interaction design. Although broad policy implications are beyond the scope of this paper, we conclude by questioning the application of the ethical/legal doctrine of informed consent to online transactions in the light of the evidence that users frequently do not consult privacy policies.},

We present a straightforward traffic analysis attack against encrypted HTTP streams that is surprisingly effective in identifying the source of the traffic. An attacker starts by creating a profile of the statistical characteristics of web requests from interesting sites, including distributions of packet sizes and inter-arrival times. Later, candidate encrypted streams are compared against these profiles. In our evaluations using real traffic, we find that many web sites are subject to this attack. With a training period of 24 hours and a 1 hour delay afterwards, the attack achieves only 23\% accuracy. However, an attacker can easily pre-determine which of trained sites are easily identifiable. Accordingly, against 25 such sites, the attack achieves 40\% accuracy; with three guesses, the attack achieves 100\% accuracy for our data. Longer delays after training decrease accuracy, but not substantially. We also propose some countermeasures and improvements to our current method. Previous work analyzed SSL traffic to a proxy, taking advantage of a known flaw in SSL that reveals the length of each web object. In contrast, we exploit the statistical characteristics of web streams that are encrypted as a single flow, which is the case with WEP/WPA, IPsec, and SSH tunnels.},

  abstract     = {A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a multi-hop wireless network having no infrastructure. Thus, the mobile nodes have to perform basic control tasks, such as routing, and higher-level tasks, such as service discovery, in a cooperative and distributed way. Originally conceived as a peer-to-peer application for the Internet, distributed hash tables (DHTs) are data structures offering both, scalable routing and a convenient abstraction for the design of applications in large, dynamic networks. Hence, DHTs and MANETs seem to be a good match, and both have to cope with dynamic, self-organizing networks. DHTs form a virtual control structure oblivious to the underlying network. Several techniques to improve the performance of DHTs in wired networks have been established in the literature. A particularly efficient one is proximity neighbor selection (PNS). PNS has to continuously adapt the virtual network to the physical network, incurring control traffic. The applicability of PNS and DHTs for MANETs commonly is regarded as hard because of this control traffic,the complexity of the adaptation algorithms, and the dynamics of a MANET. Using simulations supported by analytical methods, we show that by making a minor addition to PNS, it is also applicable for MANETs. We additionally show that the specifics of a MANET make PNS an easy exercise there. Thus, DHTs deliver good performance in MANETs.},

Ad-hoc networks are networks made between arbitrary nodes without any form of infrastructure or central control. Backup in such environments would have to rely on other nodes to keep backups. The key problem is knowing whom to trust. Backup in ad-hoc network is meant to be a method to offer extra security to data that is created outside of a controlled environment. The most important aspects of backup are the ability to retrieve data after it is lost from the original device. In this project an ad-hoc network is simulated, to measure how much of the data can be retrieved as a function of the size of the network. The distance to the data and how many of the distributed copies are available is measured. The network is simulated using User-mode Linux and the centrality and connectivity of the simulated network is measured. Finding the device that keeps your data when a restoration is needed can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. A simple solution to this is to not only rely on the ad-hoc network but also make it possible for devices that keep backups to upload data to others or back to a host that is available to the source itself.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes how a network can continue to function in the presence of Byzantine failures. A Byzantine failure is one in which a node, instead of halting (as it would in a fail-stop failure), continues to operate, but incorrectly. It might lie about routing information, perform the routing algorithm itself flawlessly, but then fail to forward some class of packets correctly, or flood the network with garbage traffic. Our goal is to design a network so that as long as one nonfaulty path connects nonfaulty nodes A and B, they will be able to communicate, with some fair share of bandwidth, even if all the other components in the network are maximally malicious. We review work from 1988 that presented a network design that had that property, but required the network to be small enough so that every router could keep state proportional to n2, where n is the total number of nodes in the network. This would work for a network of size on the order of a thousand nodes, but to build a large network, we need to introduce hierarchy. This paper presents a new design, building on the original work, that works with hierarchical networks. This design not only defends against malicious routers, but because it guarantees fair allocation of resources, can mitigate against many other types of denial of service attacks.},

In this paper, we propose the Scalar Anonymity System (SAS) in order to provide a tradeoff between anonymity and cost for different users with different requirements. In SAS, by selecting the level of anonymity, a user obtains the corresponding anonymity and QoS and also sustains the corresponding load of traffic rerouting for other users.

  abstract  = {The design of efficient routing protocols for ad hoc and sensor networks is challenging for several reasons: Physical network topology is random. Nodes have limited computation and memory capabilities. Energy and bisection bandwidth are scarce. Furthermore, in most settings, the lack of centralized components leaves all network control tasks to the nodes acting as decentralized peers. In this paper, we present a novel routing algorithm, scalable source routing (SSR), which is capable of memory and message efficient routing in large random networks. A guiding example is a community of {\textquoteright}digital homes {\textquoteright} where smart sensors and actuators are installed by laypersons. Such networks combine wireless ad-hoc and infrastructure networks, and lack a well-crafted network topology. Typically, the nodes do not have sufficient processing and memory resources to perform sophisticated routing algorithms. Flooding on the other hand is too bandwidthconsuming in the envisaged large-scale networks. SSR is a fully self-organizing routing protocol for such scenarios. It creates a virtual ring that links all nodes via predecessor/successor source routes. Additionally, each node possesses O(log N) short-cut source routes to nodes in exponentially increasing virtual ring distance. Like with the Chord overlay network, this ensures full connectivity within the network. Moreover, it provides a routing semantic which can efficiently support indirection schemes like i3. Memory and message efficiency are achieved by the introduction of a route cache together with a set of path manipulation rules that allow to produce near-to-optimal paths.},

While a number of existing service discovery protocols have shown to be effective for the wireless environment, these are mainly aimed at infrastructure-based and/or 1-hop ad hoc wireless networks. Some discovery protocols for MANETs have been proposed over the last couple of years but they induce significant traffic overhead, and are thus primarily suited for small-scale MANETs with few nodes. Building upon the evaluation of existing protocols, we introduce a scalable service discovery protocol for MANETs, which is based on the homogeneous and dynamic deployment of cooperating directories within the network. Scalability of our protocol comes from the minimization of the generatedtraffic, and the use of compact directory summaries that enable to efficiently locate the directory that most likely caches the description of a given service.},

Famously, the psychologist Stanley Milgram performed an experiment where he asked people to deliver a letter to a stranger by forwarding it to an acquaintance, who could forward it to one his acquaintances, and so on until the destination was reached. The results seemed to confirm that the small-world phenomenon is real. Recently it has been shown by Jon Kleinberg that in order to search in a network, that is to actually find the short paths in the manner of the Milgram experiment, a very special type of a graph model is needed. In this thesis, we present two ideas about searching in the small world stemming from Kleinberg{\textquoteright}s results.

To model such games he introduced the Harsanyi transformation, which converts a game with incomplete information to a strategic game where players may have different types. In the resulting Bayesian game players{\textquoteright} uncertainty about each others types is described by a probability distribution over all possible type profiles.In this work, we introduce a particular selfish routing game with incomplete information that we call Bayesian routing game. Here, n selfish users wish to assign their traffic to one of m links. Users do not know each others traffic. Following Harsanyi{\textquoteright}s approach, we introduce for each user a set of possible types.This paper presents a comprehensive collection of results for the Bayesian routing game.We prove, with help of a potential function, that every Bayesian routing game possesses a pure Bayesian Nash equilibrium. For the model of identical links and independent type distribution we give a polynomial time algorithm to compute a pure Bayesian Nash equilibrium.We study structural properties of fully mixed Bayesian Nash equilibria for the model of identical links and show that they maximize individual cost. In general there exists more than one fully mixed Bayesian Nash equilibrium. We characterize the class of fully mixed Bayesian Nash equilibria in the case of independent type distribution.We conclude with results on coordination ratio for the model of identical links for three social cost measures, that is, social cost as expected maximum congestion, sum of individual costs and maximum individual cost. For the latter two we are able to give (asymptotic) tight bounds using our results on fully mixed Bayesian Nash equilibria.To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that mixed Bayesian Nash equilibria have been studied in conjunction with social cost.},

The DVDR is a collaboration system of existing video disk recorders via a peer to peer network. There, the VDRs communicate about the tasks to be done and distribute the recordings afterwards. In this paper, we report on lessons learnt during its implementation and explain the considerations leading to the design of a new job scheduling algorithm. DVDR is an application which is based on a distributed hash table (DHT) employing proximity route selection (PRS)/proximity neighbor selection (PNS). For our implementation, we chose to use Chord [SMK + 01, GGG + 03]. Using a DHT with PRS/PNS yields two important features: (1) Each hashed key is routed to exactly one destination node within the system. (2) PRS/PNS forces messages originating in one region of the network destined to the same key to be routed through exactly one node in that region (route convergence). The first property enables per-key aggregation trees with a tree being rooted at the node which is responsible for the respective key. This node serves as a rendezvous point. The second property leads to locality (i.e., low latency) in this aggregation tree.},

Currency budgets may be distributed among consumers according to any global policy; consumers spend their budgets to schedule their resource usage through time, but cannot hoard their currency or starve.We outline the design and rationale for self-recharging currency in Cereus, a system for market-based community resource sharing, in which participants are authenticated and sanctions are sufficient to discourage fraudulent behavior. Currency transactions in Cereus are accountable: offline third-party audits can detect and prove cheating, so participants may transfer and recharge currency autonomously without involvement of the trusted banking service.},

  abstract  = {Large networks require scalable routing. Traditionally, protocol overhead is reduced by introducing a hierarchy. This requires aggregation of nearby nodes under a common address prefix. In fixed networks, this is achieved administratively, whereas in wireless ad-hoc networks, dynamic assignments of nodes to aggregation units are required. As a result of the nodes commonly being assigned a random network address, the majority of proposed ad-hoc routing protocols discovers routes between end nodes by flooding, thus limiting the network size. Peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks offer scalable routing solutions by employing virtualized address spaces, yet assume an underlying routing protocol for end-to-end connectivity. We investigate a cross-layer approach to P2P routing, where the virtual address space is implemented with a network-layer routing protocol by itself. The Iterative Successor Pointer Rewiring Protocol (ISPRP) efficiently initializes a ring-structured network among nodes having but link-layer connectivity. It is fully self-organizing and issues only a small per-node amount of messages by keeping interactions between nodes as local as possible. The main contribution of this paper is a proof that ISPRP is self-stabilizing, that is, starting from an arbitrary initial state, the protocol lets the network converge into a correct state within a bounded amount of time.},

We discuss characteristics of VSD architecture and methods to improve connectivity among volunteers for higher discovery rate. By showing that VSD performs quite well compared to a broadcast based scheme in MANET scenarios, we validate that VSD is a flexible and adaptable architecture appropriate for dynamic pervasive computing environments. VSD incorporates several novel features: i) handles dynamism and supports self-reconfiguration; ii) provides physical locality and scalability; and iii) improves reliability and copes with uncertainty through redundancy by forming overlapped clusters.

  abstract     = {If agents are to negotiate automatically with one another they must share a negotiation mechanism, specifying what possible actions each party can take at any given time, when negotiation terminates, and what is the structure of the resulting agreements. Current standardization activities such as FIPA [2] and WS-Agreement [3] represent this as a negotiation protocol specifying the flow of messages. However, they omit other aspects of the rules of negotiation (such as obliging a participant to improve on a previous offer), requiring these to be represented implicitly in an agent{\textquoteright}s design, potentially resulting incompatibility, maintenance and re-usability problems. In this chapter, we propose an alternative approach, allowing all of a mechanism to be formal and explicit. We present (i) a taxonomy of declarative rules which can be used to capture a wide variety of negotiation mechanisms in a principled and well-structured way; (ii) a simple interaction protocol, which is able to support any mechanism which can be captured using the declarative rules; (iii) a software framework for negotiation that allows agents to effectively participate in negotiations defined using our rule taxonomy and protocol and (iv) a language for expressing aspects of the negotiation based on OWL-Lite [4]. We provide examples of some of the mechanisms that the framework can support.},

Our results confirm that BitTorrent performs near-optimally in terms of uplink bandwidth utilization and download time, except under certain extreme conditions. On fairness, however, our work shows that low bandwidth peers systematically download more than they upload to the network when high bandwidth peers are present. We find that the rate-based tit-for-tat policy is not effective in preventing unfairness. We show how simple changes to the tracker and a stricter, block-based tit-for-tat policy, greatly improves fairness, while maintaining high utilization.},

[GKK04]. We discover that this scheme and its extension both are insecure against a chosen ciphertext attack proposed by Pfitzmann in 1994 [Pfi94]. Another drawback of them is low efficiency for anonymous communications due to their long ciphertexts, i.e., four times the size of plaintext. Accordingly, we devise a novel universal and efficient anonymous tunnel, rWonGoo, for circuit-based low-latency communications in large scale peer-to-peer environments to dramatically decrease possibility to suffer from the attack [Pfi94]. The basic idea behind rWonGoo is to provide anonymity with re-encryption and random forwarding, obtaining practicality, correctness and efficiency in encryption in the way differing from the layered encryption systems [Cha81] that can be difficult to achieve correctness of tunnels.},

  abstract  = {Over the Internet today, computing and communications environments are significantly more complex and chaotic than classical distributed systems, lacking any centralized organization or hierarchical control. There has been much interest in emerging Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network overlays because they provide a good substrate for creating large-scale data sharing, content distribution and application-level multicast applications. These P2P networks try to provide a long list of features such as: selection of nearby peers, redundant storage, efficient search/location of data items, data permanence or guarantees, hierarchical naming, trust and authentication, and, anonymity. P2P networks potentially offer an efficient routing architecture that is self-organizing, massively scalable, and robust in the wide-area, combining fault tolerance, load balancing and explicit notion of locality. In this paper, we present a survey and comparison of various Structured and Unstructured P2P networks. We categorize the various schemes into these two groups in the design spectrum and discuss the application-level network performance of each group.},

Designers of such systems want them used in open networks, where an adversary can perform a sybil attack by introducing a large number of corrupt nodes in the network, considerably degrading its performance. We introduce a routing strategy that alleviates some of the effects of such an attack by making sure that lookups are performed using a diverse set of nodes. This ensures that at least some of the nodes queried are good, and hence the search makes forward progress. This strategy makes use of latent social information present in the introduction graph of the network.},

If such behavior violates system policy then it constitutes an attack. In this paper we identify and create a taxonomy for rational attacks and then identify corresponding solutions if they exist. The most effective solutions directly incentivize cooperative behavior, but when this is not feasible the common alternative is to incentivize evidence of cooperation instead.},

We consider a conflict, and there are parties to the conflict. There is communication going on that can be abstracted as a network of nodes (parties) and links (social ties between the nodes). We contend that once you{\textquoteright}ve got a conflict and you{\textquoteright}ve got enough parties to it, these guys start communicating as a result of the conflict. They form connections, that influences the conflict, and the dynamics of the conflict in turn feeds the connectivity of the unfolding network.
Modern conflicts often turn on connectivity: consider, for instance, anything from the American army{\textquoteright}s attack on the Taleban in Afghanistan, and elsewhere, or medics who are trying to battle a disease, like Aids, or anything else. All of these turn on, making strategic decisions about which nodes to go after in the network. For instance, you could consider that a good first place to give condoms out and start any Aids programme, would be with prostitutes.},

Contrary to the goal of achieving an invisible computer, the required amount of management and human intervention increases more and more, both slowing down the growth rate and limiting the achievable size of ubiquitous systems.
In this paper we present a novel routing approach that is capable of handling complex networks without any administrative intervention. Based on a combination of standard overlay routing techniques and source routes, this approach is capable of efficiently bootstrapping a routable network. Unlike other approaches that try to combine peer-to-peer ideas with ad-hoc networks, sensor networks, or ubiquitous systems, our approach is not based on a routing scheme. This makes the resulting system flexible and powerful with respect at application support as well as efficient with regard to routing overhead and system complexity.},

This result is in contrast to many people{\textquoteright}s perception. The key idea is to embed a unique watermark into the encrypted VoIP flow by slightly adjusting the timing of selected packets. Our analysis shows that it only takes several milliseconds time adjustment to make normal VoIP flows highly unique and the embedded watermark could be preserved across the low latency anonymizing network if appropriate redundancy is applied. Our analytical results are backed up by the real-time experiments performed on leading peer-to-peer VoIP client and on a commercially deployed anonymizing network. Our results demonstrate that (1) tracking anonymous peer-to-peer VoIP calls on the Internet is feasible and (2) low latency anonymizing networks are susceptible to timing attacks.},

This algorithm enables sensor networks to use recent peer to-peer mechanisms from the field of overlay networks, like e.g. distributed hash tables and indirection infrastructures. Unlike other proposals along that direction, SSR integrates all necessary routing tasks into one simple, highly efficient routing protocol. Simulations demonstrate that in a small-world network with more than 100 000 nodes, SSR requires each node to only store routing data for 255 other nodes to establish routes between arbitrary pairs of nodes. These routes are on average only about 20-30\% longer than the globally optimal path between these nodes.

We show how to split, replicate, and erasure code message fragments over multiple delivery paths to optimize the probability of successful message delivery. We provide a formulation of this problem and solve it for two cases: a 0/1 (Bernoulli) path delivery model where messages are either fully lost or delivered, and a Gaussian path delivery model where only a fraction of a message may be delivered. Ideas from the modern portfolio theory literature are borrowed to solve the underlying optimization problem. Our approach is directly relevant to solving similar problems that arise in replica placement in distributed file systems and virtual node placement in DHTs. In three different simulated DTN scenarios covering a wide range of applications, we show the effectiveness of our approach in handling failures.},

  abstract     = {Encapsulating messages in onions is one of the major techniques providing anonymous communication in computer networks. To some extent, it provides security against traffic analysis by a passive adversary. However, it can be highly vulnerable to attacks by an active adversary. For instance, the adversary may perform a simple so{\textendash}called repetitive attack: a malicious server sends the same massage twice, then the adversary traces places where the same message appears twice {\textendash} revealing the route of the original message. A repetitive attack was examined for mix{\textendash}networks. However, none of the countermeasures designed is suitable for onion{\textendash}routing.
In this paper we propose an {\textquotedblleft}onion-like{\textquotedblright} encoding design based on universal reencryption. The onions constructed in this way can be used in a protocol that achieves the same goals as the classical onions, however, at the same time we achieve immunity against a repetitive attack. Even if an adversary disturbs communication and prevents processing a message somewhere on the onion path, it is easy to identify the malicious server performing the attack and provide an evidence of its illegal behavior.},

Such a simple scheme eliminates free riding, is incentive compatible and obtains a value of social welfare that is within o(n) of that obtained by the second-best policy of the corresponding mechanism design formulation of the problem. We extend our model to account for file popularity, and discuss properties of the resulting equilibria. The fact that a simple optimization problem can be used to closely approximate the solution of the exact model (which is in most cases practically intractable both analytically and computationally), is of great importance for studying several interesting aspects of the system. We consider the evolution of the system to equilibrium in its early life, when both peers and the system planner are still learning about system parameters. We also analyse the case of group formation when peers belong to different classes (such as DSL and dial-up users), and it may be to their advantage to form distinct groups instead of a larger single group, or form such a larger group but avoid disclosing their class. We finally discuss the game that occurs when peers know that a fixed fee will be used, but the distribution of their valuations is unknown to the system designer.},

Although a few studies have been devoted to characterizing its properties, such as its workload and the stability of the top-level servers, many key components of DNS have not yet been examined. Based on large-scale measurements taken fromservers in a large content distribution network, we present a detailed study of key characteristics of the DNS infrastructure, such as load distribution, availability, and deployment patterns of DNS servers. Our analysis includes both local DNS servers and servers in the authoritative hierarchy. We find that (1) the vast majority of users use a small fraction of deployed name servers, (2) the availability of most name servers is high, and (3) there exists a larger degree of diversity in local DNS server deployment and usage than for authoritative servers. Furthermore, we use our DNS measurements to draw conclusions about federated infrastructures in general. We evaluate and discuss the impact of federated deployment models on future systems, such as Distributed Hash Tables.},

We determine that assumptions made in previous literature about the distribution of mix input traffic are incorrect: in particular, the input traffic does not follow a Poisson distribution. We establish for the first time that a lower bound exists on the anonymity of Mixmaster, and discover that under certain circumstances the algorithm used by Reliable provides no anonymity. We find that the upper bound on anonymity provided by Mixmaster is slightly higher than that provided by Reliable.
We identify flaws in the software in Reliable that further compromise its ability to provide anonymity, and review key areas that are necessary for the security of a mix in addition to a sound algorithm. Our analysis can be used to evaluate under which circumstances the two mixing algorithms should be used to best achieve anonymity and satisfy their purpose. Our work can also be used as a framework for establishing a security review process for mix node deployments.},

  abstract  = {There are many research interests in peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay architectures. Most widely used unstructured P2P networks rely on central directory servers or massive message flooding, clearly not scalable. Structured overlay networks based on distributed hash tables (DHT) are expected to eliminate flooding and central servers, but can require many long-haul message deliveries. An important aspect of constructing an efficient overlay network is how to exploit network locality in the underlying network. We propose a novel mechanism, mOverlay, for constructing an overlay network that takes account of the locality of network hosts. The constructed overlay network can significantly decrease the communication cost between end hosts by ensuring that a message reaches its destination with small overhead and very efficient forwarding. To construct the locality-aware overlay network, dynamic landmark technology is introduced. We present an effective locating algorithm for a new host joining the overlay network. We then present a theoretical analysis and simulation results to evaluate the network performance. Our analysis shows that the overhead of our locating algorithm is O(logN), where N is the number of overlay network hosts. Our simulation results show that the average distance between a pair of hosts in the constructed overlay network is only about 11\% of the one in a traditional, randomly connected overlay network. Network design guidelines are also provided. Many large-scale network applications, such as media streaming, application-level multicasting, and media distribution, can leverage mOverlay to enhance their performance.},

We first recall two main redundancy mechanisms: replication and erasure codes, which are used by most peer to peer storage systems like OceanStore, PAST or CFS, to guarantee data durability. Second we characterize peer to peer systems according to a volatility factor (a peer is free to leave the system at anytime) and to an availability factor (a peer is not permanently connected to the system). Third we model the behavior of a system as a Markov chain and analyse the average life time of data (MTTF) according to the volatility and availability factors. We also present the cost of the repair process based on these redundancy schemes to recover failed peers. The conclusion of this study is that when there is no high availability of peers, a simple replication scheme may be more efficient than sophisticated erasure codes.

  abstract     = {Overlay networks are widely used to deploy functionality at edge nodes without changing network routers. Each node in an overlay network maintains pointers to a set of neighbor nodes. These pointers are used both to maintain the overlay and to implement application functionality, for example, to locate content stored by overlay nodes. If an attacker controls a large fraction of the neighbors of correct nodes, it can "eclipse" correct nodes and prevent correct overlay operation. This Eclipse attack is more general than the Sybil attack. Attackers can use a Sybil attack to launch an Eclipse attack by inventing a large number of seemingly distinct overlay nodes. However, defenses against Sybil attacks do not prevent Eclipse attacks because attackers may manipulate the overlay maintenance algorithm to mount an Eclipse attack. This paper discusses the impact of the Eclipse attack on several types of overlay and it proposes a novel defense that prevents the attack by bounding the degree of overlay nodes. Our defense can be applied to any overlay and it enables secure implementations of overlay optimizations that choose neighbors according to metrics like proximity. We present preliminary results that demonstrate the importance of defending against the Eclipse attack and show that our defense is effective.},

We have developed a clustering protocol named {\textquotedblleft}On-Demand Group Mobility-Based Clustering {\textquotedblright} (ODGMBC) which is reactive. Its goal is to build clusters as a basis for address autoconfiguration and hierarchical routing. The design process especially addresses the notion of group mobility in a MANET. As a result, ODGMBC maps varying physical node groups onto logical clusters. In this paper, ODGMBC is described. It was implemented for the ad hoc network simulator GloMoSim [2] and evaluated using several performance indicators. Simulation results are promising and show that ODGMBC leads to stable clusters. This stability is advantageous for autoconfiguration and routing mechansims to be employed in conjunction with the clustering algorithm.

Existing systems have explored a range of solutions, including iterative routing, recursive routing, proximity routing and neighbor selection, erasure coding, replication, and server selection.

This paper explores the design of these techniques and their interaction in a complete system, drawing on the measured performance of a new DHT implementation and results from a simulator with an accurate Internet latency model. New techniques that resulted from this exploration include use of latency predictions based on synthetic co-ordinates, efficient integration of lookup routing and data fetching, and a congestion control mechanism suitable for fetching data striped over large numbers of servers.

Measurements with 425 server instances running on 150 PlanetLab and RON hosts show that the latency optimizations reduce the time required to locate and fetch data by a factor of two. The throughput optimizations result in a sustainable bulk read throughput related to the number of DHT hosts times the capacity of the slowest access link; with 150 selected PlanetLab hosts, the peak aggregate throughput over multiple clients is 12.8 megabytes per second.},

  abstract     = {Dining cryptographers networks (or DC-nets) are a privacy-preserving primitive devised by Chaum for anonymous message publication. A very attractive feature of the basic DC-net is its non-interactivity. Subsequent to key establishment, players may publish their messages in a single broadcast round, with no player-to-player communication. This feature is not possible in other privacy-preserving tools like mixnets. A drawback to DC-nets, however, is that malicious players can easily jam them, i.e., corrupt or block the transmission of messages from honest parties, and may do so without being traced.
Several researchers have proposed valuable methods of detecting cheating players in DC-nets. This is usually at the cost, however, of multiple broadcast rounds, even in the optimistic case, and often of high computational and/or communications overhead, particularly for fault recovery.
We present new DC-net constructions that simultaneously achieve non-interactivity and high-probability detection and identification of cheating players. Our proposals are quite efficient, imposing a basic cost that is linear in the number of participating players. Moreover, even in the case of cheating in our proposed system, just one additional broadcast round suffices for full fault recovery. Among other tools, our constructions employ bilinear maps, a recently popular cryptographic technique for reducing communication complexity.},

  abstract  = {Since the advent of Gnutella, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) protocols have matured towards a fundamental design element for large-scale, self-organising distributed systems. Many research efforts have been invested to improve various aspects of P2P systems, like their performance, scalability, and so on. However, little experience has been gathered from the actual deployment of such P2P systems apart from the typical file sharing applications. To bridge this gap and to gain more experience in making the transition from theory to practice, we started building advanced P2P applications whose explicit goal is {\textquotedblleft}to be deployed in the wild{\textquotedblright}. In this paper, we describe a fully decentralised P2P video recording system. Every node in the system is a networked computer (desktop PC or set-top box) capable of receiving and recording DVB-S, i.e. digital satellite TV. Like a normal video recorder, users can program their machines to record certain programmes. With our system, they will be able to schedule multiple recordings in parallel. It is the task of the system to assign the recordings to different machines in the network. Moreover, users can {\textquotedblleft}record broadcasts in the past{\textquotedblright}, i.e. the system serves as a short-term archival storage.},

  abstract     = {A serious weakness of the onion protocol, one of the major tools for anonymous communication, is its vulnerability to network failures and/or an adversary trying to break the communication. This is facilitated by the fact that each message is sent through a path of a certain length and a failure in a single point of this path prohibits message delivery. Since the path cannot be too short in order to offer anonymity protection (at least logarithmic in the number of nodes), the failure probability might be quite substantial.
The simplest solution to this problem would be to send many onions with the same message. We show that this approach can be optimized with respect to communication overhead and resilience to failures and/or adversary attacks. We propose two protocols: the first one mimics K independent onions with a single onion. The second protocol is designed for the case where an adaptive adversary may destroy communication going out of servers chosen according to the traffic observed by him. In this case a single message flows in a stream of K onions {\textemdash} the main point is that even when the adversary kills some of these onions, the stream quickly recovers to the original bandwidth {\textemdash} again K onions with this message would flow through the network.},

In particular, the use of energy consuming memory, SDRAM, has become burdensome in battery-powered embedded systems. Intuitively, though demand paging can be used to mitigate the increasing requirement of main memory size, its applicability should be deliberately elaborated since NAND flash memory has asymmetric operation characteristics in terms of performance and energy consumption.In this paper, we present energy-aware demand paging technique to lower the energy consumption of embedded systems considering the characteristics of interactive embedded applications with large memory footprints. We also propose a flash memory-aware page replacement policy that can reduce the number of write and erase operations in NAND flash memory. With real-life workloads, we show the system-wide Energy{\textperiodcentered}Delay can be reduced by 15~30\% compared to the traditional shadowing architecture.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental vision driving pervasive computing research is access to personal and shared data anywhere at anytime. In many ways, this vision is close to being realized. Wireless networks such as 802.11 offer connectivity to small, mobile devices. Portable storage, such as mobile disks and USB keychains, let users carry several gigabytes of data in their pockets. Yet, at least three substantial barriers to pervasive data access remain. First, power-hungry network and storage devices tax the limited battery capacity of mobile computers. Second, the danger of viewing stale data or making inconsistent updates grows as objects are replicated across more computers and portable storage devices. Third, mobile data access performance can suffer due to variable storage access times caused by dynamic power management, mobility, and use of heterogeneous storage devices. To overcome these barriers, we have built a new distributed file system called BlueFS. Compared to the Coda file system, BlueFS reduces file system energy usage by up to 55\% and provides up to 3 times faster access to data replicated on portable storage.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address issues related to flow correlation attacks and the corresponding countermeasures in mix networks. Mixes have been used in many anonymous communication systems and are supposed to provide countermeasures that can defeat various traffic analysis attacks. In this paper, we focus on a particular class of traffic analysis attack, flow correlation attacks, by which an adversary attempts to analyze the network traffic and correlate the traffic of a flow over an input link at a mix with that over an output link of the same mix. Two classes of correlation methods are considered, namely time-domain methods and frequency-domain methods. Based on our threat model and known strategies in existing mix networks, we perform extensive experiments to analyze the performance of mixes. We find that a mix with any known batching strategy may fail against flow correlation attacks in the sense that for a given flow over an input link, the adversary can correctly determine which output link is used by the same flow. We also investigated methods that can effectively counter the flow correlation attack and other timing attacks. The empirical results provided in this paper give an indication to designers of Mix networks about appropriate configurations and alternative mechanisms to be used to counter flow correlation attacks.

A user decides whether to contribute or free-ride based on how the current contribution cost in the system compares to her type. When the societal generosity (i.e., the average type) is low, intervention is required in order to sustain the system. We present the effect of mechanisms that exclude low type users or, more realistic, penalize free-riders with degraded service. We also consider dynamic scenarios with arrivals and departures of users, and with whitewashers: users who leave the system and rejoin with new identities to avoid reputational penalties. We find that when penalty is imposed on all newcomers in order to avoid whitewashing, system performance degrades significantly only when the turnover rate among users is high.},

In this work we present a more efficient way to accomplish this goal, i.e. we need less observations by looking for unique minimal hitting sets. We call this the hitting set attack or just HS-attack.
In general, solving the minimal hitting set problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we use frequency analysis to enhance the applicability of our attack. It is possible to apply highly efficient backtracking search algorithms. We call this approach the statistical hitting set attack or SHS-attack.
However, the statistical hitting set attack is prone to wrong solutions with a given small probability. We use here duality checking algorithms to resolve this problem. We call this final exact attack the HS*-attack.},

  abstract  = {We propose a new specification framework for information hiding properties such as anonymity and privacy. The framework is based on the concept of a function view, which is a concise representation of the attacker{\textquoteright}s partial knowledge about a function. We describe system behavior as a set of functions, and formalize different information hiding properties in terms of views of these functions. We present an extensive case study, in which we use the function view framework to systematically classify and rigorously define a rich domain of identity-related properties, and to demonstrate that privacy and anonymity are independent.

The key feature of our approach is its modularity. It yields precise, formal specifications of information hiding properties for any protocol formalism and any choice of the attacker model as long as the latter induce an observational equivalence relation on protocol instances. In particular, specifications based on function views are suitable for any cryptographic process calculus that defines some form of indistinguishability between processes. Our definitions of information hiding properties take into account any feature of the security model, including probabilities, random number generation, timing, etc., to the extent that it is accounted for by the formalism in which the system is specified.},

To ease the deployment of such services, this paper proposes a general, overlay-based Internet Indirection Infrastructure (i3) that offers a rendezvous-based communication abstraction. Instead of explicitly sending a packet to a destination, each packet is associated with an identifier; this identifier is then used by the receiver to obtain delivery of the packet. This level of indirection decouples the act of sending from the act of receiving, and allows i3 to efficiently support a wide variety of fundamental communication services. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we have designed and built a prototype based on the Chord lookup protocol.},

Traditionally, distributed file systems have been built around dedicated file servers which often use expensive hardware to minimize the risk of breakdown and to handle the load. System administrators are required to monitor the load and disk usage of the file servers and to manually add clients and servers to the system.

Another drawback with centralized file systems are that a lot of storage space is unused on clients. Measurements we have taken on existing computer systems has shown that a large part of the storage capacity of workstations is unused. In the system we looked at there was three times as much storage space available on workstations than was stored in the distributed file system. We have also shown that much data stored in a production use distributed file system is redundant.

The main goals for the design of Keso has been that it should make use of spare resources, avoid storing unnecessarily redundant data, scale well, be self-organizing and be a secure file system suitable for a real world environment.

By basing Keso on peer-to-peer techniques it becomes highly scalable, fault tolerant and self-organizing. Keso is intended to run on ordinary workstations and can make use of the previously unused storage space. Keso also provides means for access control and data privacy despite being built on top of untrusted components. The file system utilizes the fact that a lot of data stored in traditional file systems is redundant by letting all files that contains a datablock with the same contents reference the same datablock in the file system. This is achieved while still maintaining access control and data privacy.},

We investigate the diversity of two deployed anonymity networks, Mixmaster and Tor, with respect to an adversary who controls a single Internet administrative domain.

Specifically, we implement a variant of a recently proposed technique that passively estimates the set of administrative domains (also known as autonomous systems, or ASes) between two arbitrary end-hosts without having access to either end of the path. Using this technique, we analyze the AS-level paths that are likely to be used in these anonymity networks. We find several cases in each network where multiple nodes are in the same administrative domain. Further, many paths between nodes, and between nodes and popular endpoints, traverse the same domain.},

  abstract  = {There are a number of scenarios where it is desirable to have a wireless device connect to multiple networks simultaneously. Currently, this is possible only by using multiple wireless network cards in the device. Unfortunately, using multiple wireless cards causes excessive energy drain and consequent reduction of lifetime in battery operated devices. In this paper, we propose a software based approach, called MultiNet, that facilitates simultaneous connections to multiple networks by virtualizing a single wireless card. The wireless card is virtualized by introducing an intermediate layer below IP, which continuously switches the card across multiple networks. The goal of the switching algorithm is to be transparent to the user who sees her machine as being connected to multiple networks. We present the design, implementation, and performance of the MultiNet system.We analyze and evaluate buffering and switching algorithms in terms of delay and energy consumption. Our system has been operational for over twelve months, it is agnostic of the upper layer protocols, and works well over popular IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN cards.},

  abstract     = {We consider a model for monitoring the connectivity of a network subject to node or edge failures. In particular, we are concerned with detecting (ε, k)-failures: events in which an adversary deletes up to network elements (nodes or edges), after which there are two sets of nodes A and B, each at least an ε fraction of the network, that are disconnected from one another. We say that a set D of nodes is an (ε k)-detection set if, for any (ε k)-failure of the network, some two nodes in D are no longer able to communicate; in this way, D "witnesses" any such failure. Recent results show that for any graph G, there is an is (ε k)-detection set of size bounded by a polynomial in k and ε, independent of the size of G.In this paper, we expose some relationships between bounds on detection sets and the edge-connectivity λ and node-connectivity κ of the underlying graph. Specifically, we show that detection set bounds can be made considerably stronger when parameterized by these connectivity values. We show that for an adversary that can delete κλ edges, there is always a detection set of size O((κ/ε) log (1/ε)) which can be found by random sampling. Moreover, an (ε, \&lambda)-detection set of minimum size (which is at most 1/ε) can be computed in polynomial time. A crucial point is that these bounds are independent not just of the size of G but also of the value of λ.Extending these bounds to node failures is much more challenging. The most technically difficult result of this paper is that a random sample of O((κ/ε) log (1/ε)) nodes is a detection set for adversaries that can delete a number of nodes up to κ, the node-connectivity.For the case of edge-failures we use VC-dimension techniques and the cactus representation of all minimum edge-cuts of a graph; for node failures, we develop a novel approach for working with the much more complex set of all minimum node-cuts of a graph.},

Several subsequent studies have examined the potential benefits of using network position in applications, and proposed alternative network positioning algorithms. In this paper, we study the problem of designing and building a network positioning system (NPS). We identify several key system-building issues such as the consistency, adaptivity and stability of host network positions over time. We propose a hierarchical network positioning architecture that maintains consistency while enabling decentralization, a set of adaptive decentralized algorithms to compute and maintain accurate, stable network positions, and finally present a prototype system deployed on PlanetLab nodes that can be used by a variety of applications.

  abstract     = {Efforts to design faster synchronous mix networks have focused on reducing the computational cost of mixing per server. We propose a different approach: our reencryption mixnet allows servers to mix inputs in parallel. The result is a dramatic reduction in overall mixing time for moderate-to-large numbers of servers. As measured in the model we describe, for n inputs and $M$ servers our parallel re encryption mixnet produces output in time at most 2n -- and only around n assuming a majority of honest servers. In contrast, a traditional, sequential, synchronous re-encryption mixnet requires time Mn.

Parallel re-encryption mixnets offer security guarantees comparable to those of synchronous mixnets, and in many cases only a slightly weaker guarantee of privacy. Our proposed construction is applicable to many recently proposed re-encryption mixnets, such as those of Furukawa and Sako, Neff, Jakobsson et al., and Golle and Boneh. In practice, parallel mixnets promise a potentially substantial time saving in applications such as anonymous electronic elections.},

PeerStore is an adaptive, cost-effective system suitable for all types of networks ranging from LAN, WAN to large unstable networks like the Internet. The system consists of two layers: metadata layer and symmetric trading layer. Locating blocks and duplicate checking is accomplished by the metadata layer while the actual data distribution is done between pairs of peers after they have established a symmetric data trade. By decoupling the metadata management from data storage, the system offers a significant reduction of the maintenance cost and preserves fairness among peers. Results show that PeerStore has a reduced maintenance cost comparing to pStore. PeerStore also realizes fairness because of the symmetric nature of the trades.},

In this paper we propose a system that solves peer-to-peer filesharing problem for wireless ad-hoc networks. Our system works according to peer-to-peer principles, without requiring a central server, and distributes information regarding the location of shared files among members of the network. By means of a {\textquotedblleft}hashline{\textquotedblright} and forming a tree-structure based on the topology of the network, the system is able to answer location queries, and also discover and maintain routing information that is used to transfer files from a source-peer to another peer.},

With the service orientation of Grid computing, the complexity of maintaining and integrating databases can be kept away from the actual users. Data access and integration is performed via services, which also allow to employ an access control. While it is our perception that many proposed Grid applications rely on a centralized and static infrastructure, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technologies might help to dynamically scale and enhance Grid applications. The focus does not lie on publicly available P2P networks here, but on the self-organizing capabilities of P2P networks in general. A P2P overlay could, e.g., be used to improve the distribution of queries in a data Grid. For studying the combination of these three technologies, Grid computing, databases, and P2P, in this paper, we use an existing application from the life sciences, drug target validation, as an example. In its current form, this system has several drawbacks. We believe that they can be alleviated by using a combination of the service-based architecture of Grid computing and P2P technologies for implementing the services. The work presented in this paper is in progress. We mainly focus on the description of the current system state, its problems and the proposed new architecture. For a better understanding, we also outline the main topics related to the work presented here.},

Each node in Vivaldi computes its coordinates by simulating its position in a network of physical springs. Vivaldi is both distributed and efficient: no fixed infrastructure need be deployed and a new host can compute useful coordinates after collecting latency information from only a few other hosts. Vivaldi can rely on piggy-backing latency information on application traffic instead of generating extra traffic by sending its own probe packets.This paper evaluates Vivaldi through simulations of 750 hosts, with a matrix of inter-host latencies derived from measurements between 750 real Internet hosts. Vivaldi finds synthetic coordinates that predict the measured latencies with a median relative error of 14 percent. The simulations show that a new host joining an existing Vivaldi system requires fewer than 10 probes to achieve this accuracy. Vivaldi is currently used by the Chord distributed hash table to perform proximity routing, replica selection, and retransmission timer estimation.},

Additionally, we describe how an attacker can use information about message distinguishability to speed the attack. We simulate our attacks for a variety of scenarios, focusing on the amount of information needed to link senders to their recipients. In each scenario, we show that the intersection attack is slowed but still succeeds against a steady-state mix network. We find that the attack takes an impractical amount of time when message delivery times are highly variable; when the attacker can observe very little of the network; and when users pad consistently and the adversary does not know how the network behaves in their absence.},

This provides a basis for comparing these protocols against each other. Our results show that fully connected DC-Net is the most resilient to these attacks, but it suffers from scalability issues that keep anonymity group sizes small.

  abstract     = {Suppose a number of hospitals in a geographic area want to learn how their own heart-surgery unit is doing compared with the others in terms of mortality rates, subsequent complications, or any other quality metric. Similarly, a number of small businesses might want to use their recent point-of-sales data to cooperatively forecast future demand and thus make more informed decisions about inventory, capacity, employment, etc. These are simple examples of cooperative benchmarking and (respectively) forecasting that would benefit all participants as well as the public at large, as they would make it possible for participants to avail themselves of more precise and reliable data collected from many sources, to assess their own local performance in comparison to global trends, and to avoid many of the inefficiencies that currently arise because of having less information available for their decision-making. And yet, in spite of all these advantages, cooperative benchmarking and forecasting typically do not take place, because of the participants{\textquoteright} unwillingness to share their information with others. Their reluctance to share is quite rational, and is due to fears of embarrassment, lawsuits, weakening their negotiating position (e.g., in case of over-capacity), revealing corporate performance and strategies, etc. The development and deployment of <i>private</i> benchmarking and forecasting technologies would allow such collaborations to take place without revealing any participant{\textquoteright}s data to the others, reaping the benefits of collaboration while avoiding the drawbacks. Moreover, this kind of technology would empower smaller organizations who could then cooperatively base their decisions on a much broader information base, in a way that is today restricted to only the largest corporations. This paper is a step towards this goal, as it gives protocols for forecasting and benchmarking that reveal to the participants the desired answers yet do not reveal to any participant any other participant{\textquoteright}s private data. We consider several forecasting methods, including linear regression and time series techniques such as moving average and exponential smoothing. One of the novel parts of this work, that further distinguishes it from previous work in secure multi-party computation, is that it involves floating point arithmetic, in particular it provides protocols to securely and efficiently perform division.},

  abstract  = {We propose a new keyword-based Private Information Retrieval (PIR) model that allows private modification of the database from which information is requested. In our model, the database is distributed over n servers, any one of which can act as a transparent interface for clients. We present protocols that support operations for accessing data, focusing on privately appending labelled records to the database (push) and privately retrieving the next unseen record appended under a given label (pull). The communication complexity between the client and servers is independent of the number of records in the database (or more generally, the number of previous push and pull operations) and of the number of servers. Our scheme also supports access control oblivious to the database servers by implicitly including a public key in each push, so that only the party holding the private key can retrieve the record via pull. To our knowledge, this is the first system that achieves the following properties: private database modification, private retrieval of multiple records with the same keyword, and oblivious access control. We also provide a number of extensions to our protocols and, as a demonstrative application, an unlinkable anonymous communication service using them.},

  abstract     = {We consider unlinkability of communication problem: given n users, each sending a message to some destination, encode and route the messages so that an adversary analyzing the traffic in the communication network cannot link the senders with the recipients. A solution should have a small communication overhead, that is, the number of additional messages should be kept low.
David Chaum introduced idea of mixes for solving this problem. His approach was developed further by Simon and Rackoff, and implemented later as the onion protocol. Even if the onion protocol is widely regarded as secure and used in practice, formal arguments supporting this claim are rare and far from being complete. On top of that, in certain scenarios very simple tricks suffice to break security without breaking the cryptographic primitives. It turns out that one source of difficulties in analyzing the onion protocols security is the adversary model. In a recent work, Berman, Fiat and Ta-Shma develop a new and more realistic model in which only a constant fraction of communication lines can be accessed by an adversary, the number of messages does not need to be high and the preferences of the users are taken into account. For this model they prove that with high probability a good level of unlinkability is obtained after  steps of the onion protocol where n is the number of messages sent.
In this paper we improve these results: we show that the same level of unlinkability (expressed as variation distance between certain probability distributions) is obtained with high probability already after  steps of the onion protocol. Asymptotically, this is the best result possible, since obviously (log n) steps are necessary. On top of that, our analysis is much simpler. It is based on path coupling technique designed for showing rapid mixing of Markov chains.},

Several techniques based on delta-encoding and duplicate block suppression have been shown to reduce storage overheads, with varying requirements for resources such as computation and memory. We propose a new scheme for storage reduction that reduces data sizes with an effectiveness comparable to the more expensive techniques, but at a cost comparable to the faster but less effective ones. The scheme, called Redundancy Elimination at the Block Level (REBL), leverages the benefits of compression, duplicate block suppression, and delta-encoding to eliminate a broad spectrum of redundant data in a scalable and efficient manner. REBL generally encodes more compactly than compression (up to a factor of 14) and a combination of compression and duplicate suppression (up to a factor of 6.7). REBL also encodes similarly to a technique based on delta-encoding, reducing overall space significantly in one case. Furthermore, REBL uses super-fingerprints, a technique that reduces the data needed to identify similar blocks while dramatically reducing the computational requirements of matching the blocks: it turns O(n2) comparisons into hash table lookups. As a result, using super-fingerprints to avoid enumerating matching data objects decreases computation in the resemblance detection phase of REBL by up to a couple orders of magnitude.

Namely, the lack of a pre-existing infrastructure, the high topological dynamism of these networks, the relatively low bandwidth of wireless links, as well as the limited storage and energy resources of mobile devices are issues that strongly affect the efficiency of any distributed system intended to provide ubiquitous information sharing. In this paper we describe Haddock-FS, a transparent replicated file system designed to support collaboration in the novel usage scenarios enabled by mobile environments. Haddock-FS is based on a highly available optimistic consistency protocol. In order to effectively cope with the network bandwidth and device memory constraints of these environments, Haddock-FS employs a limited size log truncation scheme and a cross-file, cross-version content similarity exploitation mechanism.},

In particular, a reputable mix may duplicate or erase messages. A reputable mixnet, however, can defend itself against charges of having authored the output messages it produces. This ability is very useful in practice, as it shields the mixnet from liability in the event that an output message is objectionable or illegal.
We propose three very efficient protocols for reputable mixnets, all synchronous. The first protocol is based on blind signatures. It works both with Chaumian decryption mixnets or re-encryption mixnets based on ElGamal, but guarantees a slightly weaker form of reputability which we call near-reputability. The other two protocols are based on ElGamal re-encryption over a composite group and offer true reputability. One requires interaction between the mixnet and the players before players submit their inputs. The other assumes no interaction prior to input submission.},

We give two new load-balancing protocols whose provable performance guarantees are within a constant factor of optimal. Our protocols refine the consistent hashing data structure that underlies the Chord (and Koorde) P2P network. Both preserve Chord{\textquoteright}s logarithmic query time and near-optimal data migration cost.Consistent hashing is an instance of the distributed hash table (DHT) paradigm for assigning items to nodes in a peer-to-peer system: items and nodes are mapped to a common address space, and nodes have to store all items residing closeby in the address space.Our first protocol balances the distribution of the key address space to nodes, which yields a load-balanced system when the DHT maps items "randomly" into the address space. To our knowledge, this yields the first P2P scheme simultaneously achieving O(log n) degree, O(log n) look-up cost, and constant-factor load balance (previous schemes settled for any two of the three).Our second protocol aims to directly balance the distribution of items among the nodes. This is useful when the distribution of items in the address space cannot be randomized. We give a simple protocol that balances load by moving nodes to arbitrary locations "where they are needed." As an application, we use the last protocol to give an optimal implementation of a distributed data structure for range searches on ordered data.},

  abstract     = {Developing sensor network applications demands a new set of tools to aid programmers. A number of simulation environments have been developed that provide varying degrees of scalability, realism, and detail for understanding the behavior of sensor networks. To date, however, none of these tools have addressed one of the most important aspects of sensor application design: that of power consumption. While simple approximations of overall power usage can be derived from estimates of node duty cycle and communication rates, these techniques often fail to capture the detailed, low-level energy requirements of the CPU, radio, sensors, and other peripherals.

In this paper, we present, a scalable simulation environment for wireless sensor networks that provides an accurate, per-node estimate of power consumption. PowerTOSSIM is an extension to TOSSIM, an event-driven simulation environment for TinyOS applications. In PowerTOSSIM, TinyOS components corresponding to specific hardware peripherals (such as the radio, EEPROM, LEDs, and so forth) are instrumented to obtain a trace of each device{\textquoteright}s activity during the simulation runPowerTOSSIM employs a novel code-transformation technique to estimate the number of CPU cycles executed by each node, eliminating the need for expensive instruction-level simulation of sensor nodes. PowerTOSSIM includes a detailed model of hardware energy consumption based on the Mica2 sensor node platform. Through instrumentation of actual sensor nodes, we demonstrate that PowerTOSSIM provides accurate estimation of power consumption for a range of applications and scales to support very large simulations.

Peer-to-peer architectures are characterized by their ability to adapt to failures and accommodate transient populations of nodes while maintaining acceptable connectivity and performance.Content distribution is an important peer-to-peer application on the Internet that has received considerable research attention. Content distribution applications typically allow personal computers to function in a coordinated manner as a distributed storage medium by contributing, searching, and obtaining digital content.In this survey, we propose a framework for analyzing peer-to-peer content distribution technologies. Our approach focuses on nonfunctional characteristics such as security, scalability, performance, fairness, and resource management potential, and examines the way in which these characteristics are reflected in---and affected by---the architectural design decisions adopted by current peer-to-peer systems.We study current peer-to-peer systems and infrastructure technologies in terms of their distributed object location and routing mechanisms, their approach to content replication, caching and migration, their support for encryption, access control, authentication and identity, anonymity, deniability, accountability and reputation, and their use of resource trading and management schemes.},

Our goal is to build a mechanism that supports fair large scale distribution in which downloads are fast, with low startup latency. We build a trading model in which peers use a pairwise currency to reconcile trading differences with each other and examine various trading strategies that peers can adopt. We show through analysis and simulation that peers who contribute to the network and take risks receive the most benefit in return. Our simulations demonstrate that peers who set high upload rates receive high download rates in return, but free-riders download very slowly compared to peers who upload. Finally, we propose a default trading strategy that is good for both the network as a whole and the peer employing it: deviating from that strategy yields little or no advantage for the peer.},

  abstract  = {Availability is a storage system property that is both highly desired and yet minimally engineered. While many systems provide mechanisms to improve availability - such as redundancy and failure recovery - how to best configure these mechanisms is typically left to the system manager. Unfortunately, few individuals have the skills to properly manage the trade-offs involved, let alone the time to adapt these decisions to changing conditions. Instead, most systems are configured statically and with only a cursory understanding of how the configuration will impact overall performance or availability. While this issue can be problematic even for individual storage arrays, it becomes increasingly important as systems are distributed - and absolutely critical for the wide-area peer-to-peer storage infrastructures being explored.
This paper describes the motivation, architecture and implementation for a new peer-to-peer storage system, called TotalRecall, that automates the task of availability management. In particular, the TotalRecall system automatically measures and estimates the availability of its constituent host components, predicts their future availability based on past behavior, calculates the appropriate redundancy mechanisms and repair policies, and delivers user-specified availability while maximizing efficiency.},

A conventional cryptosystem that permits re-encryption, such as ElGamal, does so only for a player with knowledge of the public key corresponding to a given ciphertext. In contrast, universal re-encryption can be done without knowledge of public keys. We propose an asymmetric cryptosystem with universal re-encryption that is half as efficient as standard ElGamal in terms of computation and storage.
While technically and conceptually simple, universal re-encryption leads to new types of functionality in mixnet architectures. Conventional mixnets are often called upon to enable players to communicate with one another through channels that are externally anonymous, i.e., that hide information permitting traffic-analysis. Universal re-encryption lets us construct a mixnet of this kind in which servers hold no public or private keying material, and may therefore dispense with the cumbersome requirements of key generation, key distribution, and private-key management. We describe two practical mixnet constructions, one involving asymmetric input ciphertexts, and another with hybrid-ciphertext inputs.},

So anonymity and privacy protection on one side and protection against such phenomena as spam are so far contradictory goals. We propose a mechanism that may be used to limit the mentioned side effects of privacy protection. During the protocol proposed each encrypted message admitted into the system is signed by a respective authority. Then, on its route through the network the encrypted message and the signature are re-encrypted universally. The purpose of universal re-encryption is to hide the routes of the messages from an observer monitoring the traffic. Despite re-encryption, signature of the authority remains valid. Depending on a particular application, verification of the signature is possible either off-line by anybody with the access to the ciphertext and the signature or requires contact with the authority that has issued the signature.},

Explicit measurements are often unattractive because the cost of measurement can outweigh the benefits of exploiting proximity information. Vivaldi is a simple, light-weight algorithm that assigns synthetic coordinates to hosts such that the distance between the coordinates of two hosts accurately predicts the communication latency between the hosts. Vivaldi is fully distributed, requiring no fixed network infrastructure and no distinguished hosts. It is also efficient: a new host can compute good coordinates for itself after collecting latency information from only a few other hosts. Because it requires little com-munication, Vivaldi can piggy-back on the communication patterns of the application using it and scale to a large number of hosts. An evaluation of Vivaldi using a simulated network whose latencies are based on measurements among 1740 Internet hosts shows that a 2-dimensional Euclidean model with height vectors embeds these hosts with low error (the median relative error in round-trip time prediction is 11 percent).},

  abstract     = {We introduce a game-theoretic setting for routing in a mobile ad hoc network that consists of greedy, selfish agents who accept payments for forwarding data for other agents if the payments cover their individual costs incurred by forwarding data. In this setting, we propose Ad hoc-VCG, a reactive routing protocol that achieves the design objectives of truthfulness (i.e., it is in the agents{\textquoteright} best interest to reveal their true costs for forwarding data) and cost-efficiency (i.e., it guarantees that routing is done along the most cost-efficient path) in a game-theoretic sense by paying to the intermediate nodes a premium over their actual costs for forwarding data packets. We show that the total overpayment (i.e., the sum of all premiums paid) is relatively small by giving a theoretical upper bound and by providing experimental evidence. Our routing protocol implements a variation of the well-known mechanism by Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves in a mobile network setting. Finally, we analyze a very natural routing protocol that is an adaptation of the Packet Purse Model [8] with auctions in our setting and show that, unfortunately, it does not achieve cost-efficiency or truthfulness.},

If the hash values match, we assume the blocks are identical without further ado. Users of compare-by-hash argue that this assumption is warranted because the chance of a hash collision between any two randomly generated blocks is estimated to be many orders of magnitude smaller than the chance of many kinds of hardware errors. Further analysis shows that this approach is not as risk-free as it seems at first glance.},

The adversary applies statistical recognition techniques to detect the payload traffic rates by using statistical measures like sample mean, sample variance, or sample entropy. We evaluate quantitatively the ability of the adversary to make a correct detection and derive closed-form formulas for the detection rate based on analytical models. Extensive experiments were carried out to validate the system performance predicted by the analytical method. Based on the systematic evaluations, we develop design guidelines for the proper configuration of a system in order to minimize the detection rate.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, overlay networks have become an effective alternative to IP multicast for efficient point to multipoint communication across the Internet. Typically, nodes self-organize with the goal of forming an efficient overlay tree, one that meets performance targets without placing undue burden on the underlying network. In this paper, we target high-bandwidth data distribution from a single source to a large number of receivers. Applications include large-file transfers and real-time multimedia streaming. For these applications, we argue that an overlay mesh, rather than a tree, can deliver fundamentally higher bandwidth and reliability relative to typical tree structures. This paper presents Bullet, a scalable and distributed algorithm that enables nodes spread across the Internet to self-organize into a high bandwidth overlay mesh. We construct Bullet around the insight that data should be distributed in a disjoint manner to strategic points in the network. Individual Bullet receivers are then responsible for locating and retrieving the data from multiple points in parallel.Key contributions of this work include: i) an algorithm that sends data to different points in the overlay such that any data object is equally likely to appear at any node, ii) a scalable and decentralized algorithm that allows nodes to locate and recover missing data items, and iii) a complete implementation and evaluation of Bullet running across the Internet and in a large-scale emulation environment reveals up to a factor two bandwidth improvements under a variety of circumstances. In addition, we find that, relative to tree-based solutions, Bullet reduces the need to perform expensive bandwidth probing. In a tree, it is critical that a node{\textquoteright}s parent delivers a high rate of application data to each child. In Bullet however, nodes simultaneously receive data from multiple sources in parallel, making it less important to locate any single source capable of sustaining a high transmission rate.},

Another advantage is that they only require the processors in the communication network to be busy periodically.},

By adding redundancy and distributing the backup data across many partners, a highly-reliable backup can be obtained in spite of the low reliability of the average Internet machine.

Because our scheme requires cooperation, it is potentially vulnerable to several novel attacks involving free riding (e.g., holding a partner{\textquoteright}s data is costly, which tempts cheating) or disruption. We defend against these attacks using a number of new methods, including the use of periodic random challenges to ensure partners continue to hold data and the use of disk-space wasting to make cheating unprofitable. Results from an initial prototype show that our technique is feasible and very inexpensive: it appears to be one to two orders of magnitude cheaper than existing Internet backup services.},

To achieve interoperability between them, we propose a network architecture and application interface structured around optionally-reliable asynchronous message forwarding, with limited expectations of end-to-end connectivity and node resources. The architecture operates as an overlay above the transport layers of the networks it interconnects, and provides key services such as in-network data storage and retransmission, interoperable naming, authenticated forwarding and a coarse-grained class of service.},

  abstract  = {Traditional small block Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes, like the Reed-Solomon erasure (RSE) code, are known to raise efficiency problems, in particular when they are applied to the Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC) reliable multicast protocol. In this paper we describe the design of a simple large block Low Density Generator Matrix (LDGM) codec, a particular case of LDPC code, which is capable of operating on source blocks that are several tens of megabytes long. We also explain how the iterative decoding feature of LDGM/LDPC can be used to protect a large number of small independent objects during time-limited partially-reliable sessions. We illustrate this feature with an example derived from a video streaming scheme over ALC. We then evaluate our LDGM codec and compare its performances with a well known RSE codec. Tests focus on the global efficiency and on encoding/decoding performances. This paper deliberately skips theoretical aspects to focus on practical results. It shows that LDGM/LDPC open many opportunities in the area of bulk data multicasting.},

  abstract  = {Distributed hashtables have been proposed as a way to simplify the construction of large-scale distributed applications(e.g.[1,6]). DHTs are completely decentralized systems that provide block storage on a changing collection of nodes spread throughout the Internet. Each block is identified by aunique key. DHTs spread the load of storing and serving blocks across all of the active nodes and keep the blocks available as nodes join and leave the system.

This paper presents the design and implementation of a cooperative off-site backup system, Venti-DHash. Venti-DHash is based on a DHT infrastructure and is designed to support recovery of data after a disaster by keeping regular snapshots of filesystems distributed off-site, on peers on the Internet. Where as conventional backup systems incur significant equipment costs, manual effort and high administrative overhead, we hope that a distributed backup system can alleviate these problems, making backups easy and feasible. By building this system on top of a DHT, the backup application inherits the properties of the DHT, and serves to evaluate the feasibility of using a DHT to build larg escale applications.},

For individual nodes there are however several advantages resulting from noncooperation, the most obvious being power saving. Nodes that act selfishly or even maliciously pose a threat to availability in mobile ad-hoc networks. Several approaches have been proposed to detect noncooperative nodes. In this paper, we investigate the effect of using rumors with respect to the detection time of misbehaved nodes as well as the robustness of the reputation system against wrong accusations. We propose a Bayesian approach for reputation representation, updates, and view integration. We also present a mechanism to detect and exclude potential lies. The simulation results indicate that by using this Bayesian approach, the reputation system is robust against slander while still benefitting from the speed-up in detection time provided by the use of rumors.},

However, these approaches did not consider the heterogeneous nature of the machines and the hierarchy of networks on the Internet. This paper presents Peer-to-peer Asymmetric file Sharing System(PASS), a novel approach to P2P file sharing, which accounts for the different capabilities and network locations of the participating machines. Our system selects only a portion of high-capacity machines(supernodes) for routing support, and organizes the network by using location information. We show that our key-coverage based directory replication improves the file search performance to a small constant number of routing hops, regardless of the network size.},

We present a distributed and secure method to compute global trust values, based on Power iteration. By having peers use these global trust values to choose the peers from whom they download, the network effectively identifies malicious peers and isolates them from the network.In simulations, this reputation system, called EigenTrust, has been shown to significantly decrease the number of inauthentic files on the network, even under a variety of conditions where malicious peers cooperate in an attempt to deliberately subvert the system.},

However, due to the resource constraints on sensors, it is infeasible to use traditional key management techniques such as public key cryptography and key distribution center (KDC). To facilitate the study of novel pairwise key predistribution techniques, this paper presents a general framework for establishing pairwise keys between sensors on the basis of a polynomial-based key predistribution protocol [2]. This paper then presents two efficient instantiations of the general framework: a random subset assignment key predistribution scheme and a grid-based key predistribution scheme. The analysis in this paper indicates that these two schemes have a number of nice properties, including high probability (or guarantee) to establish pairwise keys, tolerance of node captures, and low communication overhead. Finally, this paper presents a technique to reduce the computation at sensors required by these schemes.},

Although such {\textquotedblleft}altruistic punishment{\textquotedblright} may explain the high levels of cooperation in human societies, it creates an evolutionary puzzle: existing models suggest that altruistic cooperation among nonrelatives is evolutionarily stable only in small groups. Thus, applying such models to the evolution of altruistic punishment leads to the prediction that people will not incur costs to punish others to provide benefits to large groups of nonrelatives. However, here we show that an important asymmetry between altruistic cooperation and altruistic punishment allows altruistic punishment to evolve in populations engaged in one-time, anonymous interactions. This process allows both altruistic punishment and altruistic cooperation to be maintained even when groups are large and other parameter values approximate conditions that characterize cultural evolution in the small-scale societies in which humans lived for most of our prehistory.},

  abstract  = {A scalable feedback mechanism to solicit feedback from a potentially very large group of networked nodes is an important building block for many network protocols. Multicast transport protocols use it for negative acknowledgements and for delay and packet loss determination. Grid computing and peer-to-peer applications can use similar approaches to find nodes that are, at a given moment in time, best suited to serve a request. In sensor networks, such mechanisms allow to report extreme values in a resource efficient way.
In this paper we analyze several extensions to the exponential feedback algorithm [5,6] that provide an optimal way to collect extreme values from a potentially very large group of networked nodes. In contrast to prior work, we focus on how knowledge about the value distribution in the group can be used to optimize the feedback process. We describe the trade-offs that have to be decided upon when using these extensions and provide additional insight into their performance by means of simulation. Furthermore, we briefly illustrate how sample applications can benefit from the proposed mechanisms.},

In current DHT based routing algorithms, routing tasks are distributed across all system peers. However, a routing hop could happen between two widely separated peers with high network link latency which greatly increases system routing overheads.
In this paper, we propose a new P2P routing algorithm - - HIERAS to relieve this problem, it keeps scalability property of current DHT algorithms and improves system routing performance by the introduction of hierarchical structure. In HIERAS, we create several lower level P2P rings besides the highest level P2P ring. A P2P ring is a subset of the overall P2P overlay network. We create P2P rings in such a strategy that the average link latency between two peers in lower level rings is much smaller than higher level rings. Routing tasks are first executed in lower level rings before they go up to higher level rings, a large portion of routing hops previously executed in the global P2P ring are now replaced by hops in lower level rings, thus routing overheads can be reduced. The simulation results show HIERAS routing algorithm can significantly improve P2P system routing performance.},

Flexibility is an important factor in achieving good static resilience and effective proximity neighbor and route selection. Our basic finding is that, despite our initial preference for more complex geometries, the ring geometry allows the greatest flexibility, and hence achieves the best resilience and proximity performance.},

Our system, called Kelips, uses peer-to-peer gossip to partially replicate file index information. In Kelips, (a) under normal conditions, file lookups are resolved with O(1) time and complexity (i.e., independent of system size), and (b) membership changes (e.g., even when a large number of nodes fail) are detected and disseminated to the system quickly. Per-node memory requirements are small in medium-sized systems. When there are failures, lookup success is ensured through query rerouting. Kelips achieves load balancing comparable to existing systems. Locality is supported by using topologically aware gossip mechanisms. Initial results of an ongoing experimental study are also discussed.},

Subsequent P2P systems like Gnutella adopted decentralized search algorithms. However, Gnutella{\textquoteright}s notoriously poor scaling led some to propose distributed hash table solutions to the wide-area file search problem. Contrary to that trend, we advocate retaining Gnutella{\textquoteright}s simplicity while proposing new mechanisms that greatly improve its scalability. Building upon prior research [1, 12, 22], we propose several modifications to Gnutella{\textquoteright}s design that dynamically adapt the overlay topology and the search algorithms in order to accommodate the natural heterogeneity present in most peer-to-peer systems. We test our design through simulations and the results show three to five orders of magnitude improvement in total system capacity. We also report on a prototype implementation and its deployment on a testbed.

  abstract     = {Versioning file systems retain earlier versions of modified files, allowing recovery from user mistakes or system corruption. Unfortunately, conventional versioning systems do not efficiently record large numbers of versions. In particular, versioned metadata can consume as much space as versioned data. This paper examines two space-efficient metadata structures for versioning file systems and describes their integration into the Comprehensive Versioning File System (CVFS), which keeps all versions of all files. Journal-based metadata encodes each metadata version into a single journal entry; CVFS uses this structure for inodes and indirect blocks, reducing the associated space requirements by 80\%. Multiversion b-trees extend each entrys key with a timestamp and keep current and historical entries in a single tree; CVFS uses this structure for directories, reducing the associated space requirements by 99\%. Similar space reductions are predicted via trace analysis for other versioning strategies (e.g., on-close versioning). Experiments with CVFS verify that its current-version performance is sim-ilar to that of non-versioning file systems while reducing overall space needed for history data by a factor of two. Although access to historical versions is slower than con-ventional versioning systems, checkpointing is shown to mitigate and bound this effect.

The key concept can be seen in an integral interface that is used by all three programming languages. This leads to a configuration scheme which is totally transparent to the programming languages used to develop the service. In order to get a better idea about the impact of the programming language used, some measurement experiments were conducted.},

  year      = {2003},
  abstract  = {AMnet is a programmable network that aims at the flexible and rapid creation of services within an IP network. Examples for typical services include network layer enhancements e.g. for multicast and mobility, transport layer enhancements e.g. to integrate wireless LANs, and various application layer services e.g. for media transcoding and content distribution. AMnet is based on regular Linux boxes that run an execution environment (EE), a resource monitor, and a basic signaling-engine. These so-called active nodes run the services and provide support for resource-management and module-relocation. Services are created by service modules, small pieces of code, that are executed within the EE. Based on the standard netfilter mechanism of Linux, service modules have full access to the network traffic passing through the active node. This paper describes the evaluation mechanism for service setup in AMnet. In order to determine where a service module can be started, service modules are accompanied by evaluation modules. This allows service module authors to implement various customized strategies for node-selection and service setup. Examples that are supported by the AMnet evaluation mechanism are a) service setup at a fixed position, e.g. as gateway, b) along a fixed path (with variable position along that path), c) at variable positions inside the network with preferences for certain constellations, or d) at an unspecified position, e.g. for modification of multicasted traffic. The required path information is gathered by the AMnodes present in the network. By interaction with the resource monitors of the AMnodes and the service module repository of the respective administrative domain, the AMnet evaluation also ensures overall system security and stability.},

File recipes provide applications with instructions for reconstructing the original file from available CAS data blocks. We describe one such application of recipes, the CASPER distributed file system. A CASPER client opportunistically fetches blocks from nearby CAS providers to improve its performance when the connection to a file server traverses a low-bandwidth path. We use measurements of our prototype to evaluate its performance under varying network conditions. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in execution times of applications that use a network file system. We conclude by describing fuzzy block matching, a promising technique for using approximately matching blocks on CAS providers to reconstitute the exact desired contents of a file at a client.},

  abstract  = {This paper has been submitted for publication. Please see the above URL for current publication status. As peer-to-peer and widely distributed storage systems proliferate, the need to perform efficient erasure coding, instead of replication, is crucial to performance and efficiency. Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes have arisen as alternatives to standard erasure codes, such as Reed-Solomon codes, trading off vastly improved decoding performance for inefficiencies in the amount of data that must be acquired to perform decoding. The scores of papers written on LDPC codes typically analyze their collective and asymptotic behavior. Unfortunately, their practical application requires the generation and analysis of individual codes for finite systems. This paper attempts to illuminate the practical considerations of LDPC codes for peer-to-peer and distributed storage systems. The three main types of LDPC codes are detailed, and a huge variety of codes are generated, then analyzed using simulation. This analysis focuses on the performance of individual codes for finite systems, and addresses several important heretofore unanswered questions about employing LDPC codes in real-world systems. This material is based upon work supported by the National},

  abstract     = {Recently, David Chaum proposed an electronic voting scheme that combines visual cryptography and digital processing. It was designed to meet not only mathematical security standards, but also to be accepted by voters that do not trust electronic devices.
In this scheme mix-servers are used to guarantee anonymity of the votes in the counting process. The mix-servers are operated by different parties, so an evidence of their correct operation is necessary. For this purpose the protocol uses randomized partial checking of Jakobsson et al., where some randomly selected connections between the (encoded) inputs and outputs of a mix-server are revealed. This leaks some information about the ballots, even if intuitively this information cannot be used for any efficient attack.
We provide a rigorous stochastic analysis of how much information is revealed by randomized partial checking in the Chaums protocol. We estimate how many mix-servers are necessary for a fair security level. Namely, we consider probability distribution of the permutations linking the encoded votes with the decoded votes given the information revealed by randomized partial checking. We show that the variation distance between this distribution and the uniform distribution is already for a constant number of mix-servers (n is the number of voters). This means that a constant number of trustees in the Chaums protocol is enough to obtain provable security. The analysis also shows that certain details of the Chaums protocol can be simplified without lowering security level.},

It ensures low hand-shaking overhead between peers that download files (or parts of files) from each other. It is computationally efficient, with cost linear in the amount of data transfered. Most importantly, when nodes leave the network in the middle of uploads, the algorithm minimizes the duplicate information shared by nodes with truncated downloads.

Our method relies on the use of multicast, along with a novel cryptographic primitive that we call an Incomparable Public Key cryptosystem, which allows a receiver to efficiently create many anonymous "identities" for itself without divulging that these separate "identities" actually refer to the same receiver, and without increasing the receiver{\textquoteright}s workload as the number of identities increases. We describe the details of our method, along with a prototype implementation.},

Peer-to-peer content distribution is attractive in this setting because the bandwidth available to serve content scales with demand. A key challenge, however, is making content distribution robust to peer transience. Our approach to providing robustness is to introduce redundancy, both in network paths and in data. We use multiple, diverse distribution trees to provide redundancy in network paths and multiple description coding (MDC) to provide redundancy in data.We present a simple tree management algorithm that provides the necessary path diversity and describe an adaptation framework for MDC based on scalable receiver feedback. We evaluate these using MDC applied to real video data coupled with real usage traces from a major news site that experienced a large flash crowd for live streaming content. Our results show very significant benefits in using multiple distribution trees and MDC, with a 22 dB improvement in PSNR in some cases.},

Yet the ability to reply one or more times, and to further reply to replies, is essential to a complete anonymous conversation. We propose a protocol that allows a sender of anonymous messages to establish a reusable anonymous return channel. This channel enables any recipient of one of these anonymous messages to send back one or more anonymous replies. Recipients who reply to different messages can not test whether two return channels are the same, and there-fore can not learn whether they are replying to the same person. Yet the fact that multiple recipients may send multiple replies through the same return channel helps defend against the counting attacks that defeated earlier proposals for return channels. In these attacks, an adversary traces the origin of a message by sending a specific number of replies and observing who collects the same number of messages. Our scheme resists these attacks because the replies sent by an attacker are mixed with other replies submitted by other recipients through the same return channel. Moreover, our protocol straightforwardly allows for replies to replies, etc. Our protocol is based upon a re-encryption mix network, and requires four times the amount of computation and communication of a basic mixnet.},

Applying this reconstruction algorithm to statistical databases we show that in order to achieve  privacy one has to add perturbation of magnitude Ω (√ n). That is, smaller perturbation always results in a strong violation of privacy. We show that this result is tight by exemplifying access algorithms for statistical databases that preserve privacy while adding perturbation of magnitude

Prior solutions to this problem require centralized infrastructure, constraints on data placement, or ongoing administrative costs. All of these run counter to the design philosophy of peer-to-peer systems. requiring trusted third parties, symmetric storage relationships, monetary payment, or certified identities. Each peer that requests storage of another must agree to hold a claim in return---a placeholder that accounts for available space. After an exchange, each partner checks the other to ensure faithfulness. Samsara punishes unresponsive nodes probabilistically. Because objects are replicated, nodes with transient failures are unlikely to suffer data loss, unlike those that are dishonest or chronically unavailable. Claim storage overhead can be reduced when necessary by forwarding among chains of nodes, and eliminated when cycles are created. Forwarding chains increase the risk of exposure to failure, but such risk is modest under reasonable assumptions of utilization and simultaneous, persistent failure.},

An anycast implementation with these properties provides a key building block for distributed applications. In particular, it enables management and location of dynamic resources in large scale peer-to-peer systems.

  abstract     = {A recent trend in routing research is to avoid inefficiencies in network-level routing by allowing hosts to either choose routes themselves (e.g., source routing) or use overlay routing networks (e.g., Detour or RON). Such approaches result in selfish routing, because routing decisions are no longer based on system-wide criteria but are instead designed to optimize host-based or overlay-based metrics. A series of theoretical results showing that selfish routing can result in suboptimal system behavior have cast doubts on this approach. In this paper, we use a game-theoretic approach to investigate the performance of selfish routing in Internet-like environments. We focus on intra-domain network environments and use realistic topologies and traffic demands in our simulations. We show that in contrast to theoretical worst cases, selfish routing achieves close to optimal average latency in such environments. However, such performance benefit comes at the expense of significantly increased congestion on certain links. Moreover, the adaptive nature of selfish overlays can significantly reduce the effectiveness of traffic engineering by making network traffic less predictable.},

This works well when the interior nodes are highly-available, dedicated infrastructure routers but it poses a problem for application-level multicast in peer-to-peer systems. SplitStream addresses this problem by striping the content across a forest of interior-node-disjoint multicast trees that distributes the forwarding load among all participating peers. For example, it is possible to construct efficient SplitStream forests in which each peer contributes only as much forwarding bandwidth as it receives. Furthermore, with appropriate content encodings, SplitStream is highly robust to failures because a node failure causes the loss of a single stripe on average. We present the design and implementation of SplitStream and show experimental results obtained on an Internet testbed and via large-scale network simulation. The results show that SplitStream distributes the forwarding load among all peers and can accommodate peers with different bandwidth capacities while imposing low overhead for forest construction and maintenance.},

  abstract     = {Formation of suitable overlay-network topologiesthat are able to reflect the structure of the underlying network-infrastructure, has rarely been addressedby peer-to-peer applications so far. Often, peer-to-peerprotocols restrain to purely random formation of theiroverlay-network. This leads to a far from optimal performance of such peer-to-peer networks and ruthlesslywastes network resources.In this paper, we describe a simple mechanism thatuses programmable network technologies to improvethe topology formation process of unstructured peer-to-peer networks. Being a network service, our mechanismdoes not require any modification of existing applications or computing systems. By that, it assists networkoperators with improving the performance of their network and relieves programmers from the burden of designing and implementing topology-aware peer-to-peerprotocols.Although we use the well-know Gnutella protocol todescribe the mechanism of our proposed service, it applies to all kinds of unstructured global peer-to-peercomputing applications.},

These non-ideal characteristics are more problematic with the primitive, low-power radio transceivers found in sensor networks, and raise new issues that routing protocols must address. Link connectivity statistics should be captured dynamically through an efficient yet adaptive link estimator and routing decisions should exploit such connectivity statistics to achieve reliability. Link status and routing information must be maintained in a neighborhood table with constant space regardless of cell density. We study and evaluate link estimator, neighborhood table management, and reliable routing protocol techniques. We focus on a many-to-one, periodic data collection workload. We narrow the design space through evaluations on large-scale, high-level simulations to 50-node, in-depth empirical experiments. The most effective solution uses a simple time averaged EWMA estimator, frequency based table management, and cost-based routing.},

Therefore, they face the proxy discovery problem: how can clients discover the proxies without having the censor discover and block these proxies? To avoid widespread discovery and blocking, proxies must not be widely published and should be discovered in-band. In this paper, we present a proxy discovery mechanism called keyspace hopping that meets this goal. Similar in spirit to frequency hopping in wireless networks, keyspace hopping ensures that each client discovers only a small fraction of the total number of proxies.However, requiring clients to independently discover proxies from a large set makes it practically impossible to verify the trustworthiness of every proxy and creates the possibility of having untrusted proxies. To address
this, we propose separating the proxy into two distinct components|the messenger, which the client discovers using keyspace hopping and which simply acts as a gateway to the Internet; and the portal, whose identity is widely-published and whose responsibility it is to interpret and serve the client{\textquoteright}s requests for censored content. We show how this separation, as well as in-band proxy discovery, can be applied to a variety of anti-censorship systems.},

  abstract  = {Random-graph models are about to become an important tool in the study of wireless ad-hoc and sensor-networks, peer-to-peer networks, and, generally, overlay-networks. Such models provide a theoretical basis to assess the capabilities of certain networks, and guide the design of new protocols. Especially the recently proposed models for so-called small-world networks receive much attention from the networking community. This paper proposes the use of two more mathematical concepts for the analysis of network topologies, dimension and curvature. These concepts can intuitively be applied to, e.g., sensor-networks. But they can also be sensibly dened for certain other random-graph models. The latter is non-trivial since such models may describe purely virtual networks that do not inherit properties from an underlying physical world. Analysis of a random-graph model for Gnutella-like overlay-networks yields strong indications that such networks might be characterized as a sphere with fractal dimension.},

The majority of the users in our study were unable to tell what files they were sharing, and sometimes incorrectly assumed they were not sharing any files when in fact they were sharing all files on their hard drive. An analysis of the KaZaA network suggested that a large number of users appeared to be unwittingly sharing personal and private files, and that some users were indeed taking advantage of this and downloading files containing ostensibly private information.},

  abstract  = {The continued miniaturization in computing and wireless communication is about to make informationally enhanced environments become a reality. Already today, devices like a notebook computer or a personal digital assistent (PDA) can easily connect to the Internet via IEEE 802.11 networks (WaveLAN) or similar technologies provided at so-called hot-spots. In the near future, even smaller devices can join a wireless network to exchange status information or send and receive commands. In this paper, we present sample uses of a generic Bluetooth component that we have developed and that has been successfully integrated into various mininature devices to transmit sensor data or exchange control commands. The use of standard protocols like TCP/IP, Obex, and HTTP simplifies the use of those devices with conventional devices (notebook, PDA, cell-phone) without even requiring special drivers or applications for these devices. While such scenarios have already often been dreamt of, we are able to present a working solution based on small and cost-effective standard elements. We describe two applications that illustrate the power this approach in the broad area of e-commerce, e-learning, and e-government: the BlueWand, a small, pen-like device that can control Bluetooth devices in its vincinity by simple gestures, and a door plate that can display messages that are posted to it e.g. by a Bluetooth PDA.

These still leave the user vulnerable to long-term intersection attacks.In this paper, we propose a caching proxy system for allowing users to retrieve data from the World-Wide Web in a way that would provide recipient unobservability by a third party and sender unobservability by the recipient and thus dispose with intersection attacks, and report on the prototype we built using Google.},

In our new mix, the real cost of proving correctness is orders of magnitude faster than all other mix nets. The trade-off is that our mix only guarantees "almost entirely correct" mixing, i.e it guarantees that the mix network processed correctly all inputs with high (but not overwhelming) probability. We use a new technique for verifying correctness. This new technique consists of computing the product of a random subset of the inputs to a mix server, then require the mix server to produce a subset of the outputs of equal product. Our new mix net is of particular value for electronic voting, where a guarantee of almost entirely correct mixing may well be sufficient to announce instantly the result of a large election. The correctness of the result can later be verified beyond a doubt using any one of a number of much slower proofs of perfect-correctness, without having to mix the ballots again.},

  abstract  = {Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocols allow a user to retrieve a data item from a database while hiding the identity of the item being retrieved. Specifically, in information-theoretic, k-server PIR protocols the database is replicated among k servers, and each server learns nothing about the item the user retrieves. The cost of such protocols is measured by the communication complexity of retrieving one out of n bits of data. For any fixed k, the complexity of the best protocols prior to our work was 0(n^{\frac{1}{{2k - 1}}}) (Ambainis, 1997). Since then several methods were developed in an attempt to beat this bound, but all these methods yielded the same asymptotic bound.In this work, this barrier is finally broken and the complexity of information-theoretic k-server PIR is improved to n^{0(\frac{{\log \log k}}{{k\log k}})}. The new PIR protocols can also be used to construct k-query binary locally decodable codes of length exp (n^{0(\frac{{\log \log k}}{{k\log k}})}), compared to exp(n^{\frac{1}{{k - 1}}}) in previous constructions. The improvements presented in this paper apply even for small values of k: the PIR protocols are more efficient than previous ones for every k \geqslant 3, and the locally decodable codes are shorter for every k \geqslant 4.

While cryptographic storage techniques exist that allow users to keep data secret from untrusted servers, this work concentrates on the detection of tampering attacks and stale data. Ideally, users of an untrusted storage server would immediately and unconditionally notice any misbehavior on the part of the server. This ideal is unfortunately not achievable. However, we define a notion of data integrity called fork consistency in which, if the server delays just one user from seeing even a single change by another, the two users will never again see one another{\textquoteright}s changes---a failure easily detectable with on-line communication. We give a practical protocol for a multi-user network file system called SUNDR, and prove that SUNDR offers fork consistency whether or not the server obeys the protocol.},

We introduce a class A of analytic functions and develop a procedure to obtain degree distributions for the codes. We showvarious properties of this class which will help us construct new distributions from old ones. We then study certain types of capacity-achieving sequences and introduce new measures for their optimality. For instance, it turns out that the right-regular sequence is capacity-achieving in a much stronger sense than, e.g., the Tornado sequence. This also explains why numerical optimization techniques tend to favor graphs with only one degree of check nodes. Using our methods, we attack the problem of reducing the fraction of degree 2 variable nodes, which has important practical implications. It turns out that one can produce capacity achieving sequences for which this fraction remains below any constant, albeit at the price of slower convergence to capacity.},

Recent work has demonstrated that cooperative congestion control strategies between flows can improve performance for a variety of applications, ranging from aggregated TCP transmissions to multiple-sender multicast applications. However, in order for this cooperation to be effective, one must first identify the flows that are congested at the same set of resources. We present techniques based on loss or delay observations at end hosts to infer whether or not two flows experiencing congestion are congested at the same network resources. Our novel result is that such detection can be achieved for unicast flows, but the techniques can also be applied to multicast flows. We validate these techniques via queueing analysis, simulation and experimentation within the Internet. In addition, we demonstrate preliminary simulation results that show that the delay-based technique can determine whether two TCP flows are congested at the same set of resources. We also propose metrics that can be used as a measure of the amount of congestion sharing between two flows},

An accumulator scheme allows one to hash a large set of inputs into one short value, such that there is a short proof that a given input was incorporated into this value. A dynamic accumulator allows one to dynamically add and delete a value, such that the cost of an add or delete is independent of the number of accumulated values. We provide a construction of a dynamic accumulator and an efficient zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of an accumulated value. We prove their security under the strong RSA assumption. We then show that our construction of dynamic accumulators enables efficient revocation of anonymous credentials, and membership revocation for recent group signature and identity escrow schemes.},

  abstract  = {Over the past decade, mobile computing and wireless communication have become increasingly important drivers of many new computing applications. The field of wireless sensor networks particularly focuses on applications involving autonomous use of compute, sensing, and wireless communication devices for both scientific and commercial purposes. This paper examines the research decisions and design tradeoffs that arise when applying wireless peer-to-peer networking techniques in a mobile sensor network designed to support wildlife tracking for biology research.The ZebraNet system includes custom tracking collars (nodes) carried by animals under study across a large, wild area; the collars operate as a peer-to-peer network to deliver logged data back to researchers. The collars include global positioning system (GPS), Flash memory, wireless transceivers, and a small CPU; essentially each node is a small, wireless computing device. Since there is no cellular service or broadcast communication covering the region where animals are studied, ad hoc, peer-to-peer routing is needed. Although numerous ad hoc protocols exist, additional challenges arise because the researchers themselves are mobile and thus there is no fixed base station towards which to aim data. Overall, our goal is to use the least energy, storage, and other resources necessary to maintain a reliable system with a very high {\textquoteleft}data homing{\textquoteright} success rate. We plan to deploy a 30-node ZebraNet system at the Mpala Research Centre in central Kenya. More broadly, we believe that the domain-centric protocols and energy tradeoffs presented here for ZebraNet will have general applicability in other wireless and sensor applications.},

These systems provide efficient and fault-tolerant routing, object location, and load balancing within a self-organizing overlay network. One important aspect of these systems is how they exploit network proximity in the underlying Internet. Three basic approaches have been proposed to exploit network proximity in DHTs, geographic layout, proximity routing and proximity neighbour selection. In this position paper, we briefly discuss the three approaches, contrast their strengths and shortcomings, and consider their applicability
in the different DHT routing protocols. We conclude that proximity neighbor selection, when used in DHTs with prefixbased routing like Pastry and Tapestry, is highly effective and appears to dominate the other approaches.},

Unfortunately, the vast majority of public content on the Internet comes with no integrity or authenticity guarantees. This paper presents the self-certifying read-only file system, a content distribution system providing secure, scalable access to public, read-only data.

The read-only file system makes the security of published content independent from that of the distribution infrastructure. In a secure area (perhaps off-line), a publisher creates a digitally-signed database out of a file system{\textquoteright}s contents. The publisher then replicates the database on untrusted content-distribution servers, allowing for high availability. The read-only file system protocol furthermore pushes the cryptographic cost of content verification entirely onto clients, allowing servers to scale to a large number of clients. Measurements of an implementation show that an individual server running on a 550 Mhz Pentium III with FreeBSD can support 1,012 connections per second and 300 concurrent clients compiling a large software package.},

To counteract these measures, we propose Infranet, a system that enables clients to surreptitiously retrieve sensitive content via cooperating Web servers distributed across the global Internet. These Infranet servers provide clients access to censored sites while continuing to host normal uncensored content. Infranet uses a tunnel protocol that provides a covert communication channel between its clients and servers, modulated over standard HTTP transactions that resemble innocuous Web browsing. In the upstream direction, Infranet clients send covert messages to Infranet servers by associating meaning to the sequence of HTTP requests being made. In the downstream direction, Infranet servers return content by hiding censored data in uncensored images using steganographic techniques. We describe the design, a prototype implementation, security properties, and performance of Infranet. Our security analysis shows that Infranet can successfully circumvent several sophisticated censoring techniques.},

In particular, we emphasize that the cooperative game (also called the bargaining problem) provides an overall picture for the issue. With a simple model for Internet quality of service (QoS), we demonstrate that the leader-follower game may lead to a solution that is not Pareto optimal and in some cases may be "unfair," and that the cooperative game may provide a better solution for both the Internet service provider (ISP) and the user. The practical implication of the results is that government regulation or arbitration may be helpful. The QoS model is also applied to study the competition between two ISPs, and we find a Nash equilibrium point from which the two ISPs would not move out without cooperation. The proposed approaches can be applied to other Internet pricing problems such as the Paris Metro pricing scheme.},

Intruders who wish to attack computers attached to the Internet frequently conceal their identity by staging their attacks through intermediate {\textquotedblleft}stepping stones{\textquotedblright}. This makes tracing the source of the attack substantially more difficult, particularly if the attack traffic is encrypted. In this paper, we address the problem of tracing encrypted connections through stepping stones. The incoming and outgoing connections through a stepping stone must be correlated to accomplish this. We propose a novel correlation scheme based on inter-packet timing characteristics of both encrypted and unencrypted connections. We show that (after some filtering) inter-packet delays (IPDs) of both encrypted and unencrypted, interactive connections are preserved across many router hops and stepping stones. The effectiveness of this method for correlation purposes also requires that timing characteristics be distinctive enough to identify connections. We have found that normal interactive connections such as telnet, SSH and rlogin are almost always distinctive enough to provide correct correlation across stepping stones. The number of packets needed to correctly correlate two connections is also an important metric, and is shown to be quite modest for this method.},

  abstract     = {Traditional mix-based systems are composed of a small set of static, well known, and highly reliable mixes. To resist traffic analysis attacks at a mix, cover traffic must be used, which results in significant bandwidth overhead. End-to-end traffic analysis attacks are even more difficult to counter because there are only a few entry-and exit-points in the system. Static mix networks also suffer from scalability problems and in several countries, institutions operating a mix could be targeted by legal attacks. In this paper, we introduce MorphMix, a system for peer-to-peer based anonymous Internet usage. Each MorphMix node is a mix and anyone can easily join the system. We believe that MorphMix overcomes or reduces several drawbacks of static mix networks. In particular, we argue that our approach offers good protection from traffic analysis attacks without employing cover traffic. But MorphMix also introduces new challenges. One is that an adversary can easily operate several malicious nodes in the system and try to break the anonymity of legitimate users by getting full control over their anonymous paths. To counter this attack, we have developed a collusion detection mechanism, which allows to identify compromised paths with high probability before they are being used.},

  abstract     = {Broadcast Encryption schemes enable a center to broadcast encrypted programs so that only designated subsets of users can decrypt each program. The stateless variant of this problem provides each user with a fixed set of keys which is never updated. The best scheme published so far for this problem is the "subset difference" (SD) technique of Naor Naor and Lotspiech, in which each one of the n users is initially given O(log2(n)) symmetric encryption keys. This allows the broadcaster to define at a later stage any subset of up to r users as "revoked", and to make the program accessible only to their complement by sending O(r) short messages before the encrypted program, and asking each user to perform an O(log(n)) computation. In this paper we describe the "Layered Subset Difference" (LSD) technique, which achieves the same goal with O(log1+{\textquestiondown}(n)) keys, O(r) messages, and O(log(n)) computation. This reduces the number of keys given to each user by almost a square root factor without affecting the other parameters. In addition, we show how to use the same LSD keys in order to address any subset defined by a nested combination of inclusion and exclusion conditions with a number of messages which is proportional to the complexity of the description rather than to the size of the subset. The LSD scheme is truly practical, and makes it possible to broadcast an unlimited number of programs to 256,000,000 possible customers by giving each new customer a smart card with one kilobyte of tamper-resistant memory. It is then possible to address any subset defined by t nested inclusion and exclusion conditions by sending less than 4t short messages, and the scheme remains secure even if all the other users form an adversarial coalition.},

The basic idea is that rather than providing a proof of completely correct operation, each server provides strong evidence of its correct operation by revealing a pseudo-randomly selected subset of its input/output relations.
Randomized partial checking is exceptionally efficient compared to previous proposals for providing robustness; the evidence provided at each layer is shorter than the output of that layer, and producing the evidence is easier than doing the mixing. It works with mix nets based on any encryption scheme (i.e., on public-key alone, and on hybrid schemes using public-key/symmetric-key combinations). It also works both with Chaumian mix nets where the messages are successively encrypted with each server{\textquoteright}s key, and with mix nets based on a single public key with randomized re-encryption at each layer.
Randomized partial checking is particularly well suited for voting systems, as it ensures voter privacy and provides assurance of correct operation. Voter privacy is ensured (either probabilistically or cryptographically) with appropriate design and parameter selection. Unlike previous work, our work provides voter privacy as a global property of the mix net rather than as a property ensured by a single honest server. RPC-based mix nets also provide high assurance of a correct election result, since a corrupt server is very likely to be caught if it attempts to tamper with even a couple of ballots.},

Users{\textquoteright} preferences are summarized by means of their utility functions, and each user is allowed to request more than one type of service. Multiple types of resources are allocated at each link along the path of a connection. We assume that the relation between Quality of Service (QoS) and resource allocation is given, and we incorporate it as a constraint into a static optimization problem. The objective of the optimization problem is to determine the amount of and required resources for each type of service to maximize the sum of the users{\textquoteright} utilities. We prove the existence of a solution of the optimization problem and describe a competitive market economy that implements the solution and satisfies the informational constraints imposed by the nature of the decentralized resource allocation problem. The economy consists of four different types of agents: resource providers, service providers, users, and an auctioneer that regulates the prices based on the observed aggregate excess demand. The goods that are sold are: (i) the resources at each link of the network, and (ii) services constructed from these resources and then delivered to users. We specify an iterative procedure that is used by the auctioneer to update the prices, and we show that it leads to an allocation that is arbitrarily close to a solution of the optimization problem in a finite number of iterations.},

They proposed specific CPU-bound functions for this purpose. Burrows suggested that, since memory access speeds vary across machines much less than do CPU speeds, memory-bound functions may behave more equitably than CPU-bound functions; this approach was first explored by Abadi, Burrows, Manasse, and Wobber [5].
We further investigate this intriguing proposal. Specifically, we
1) Provide a formal model of computation and a statement of the problem;
2) Provide an abstract function and prove an asymptotically tight amortized lower bound on the number of memory accesses required to compute an acceptable proof of effort; specifically, we prove that, on average, the sender of a message must perform many unrelated accesses to memory, while the receiver, in order to verify the work, has to perform significantly fewer accesses;
3) Propose a concrete instantiation of our abstract function, inspired by the RC4 stream cipher;
4) Describe techniques to permit the receiver to verify the computation with no memory accesses;
5) Give experimental results showing that our concrete memory-bound function is only about four times slower on a 233 MHz settop box than on a 3.06 GHz workstation, and that speedup of the function is limited even if an adversary knows the access sequence and uses optimal off-line cache replacement.},

Online codes are linear encoding/decoding time codes, based on sparse bipartite graphs, similar to Tornado codes, with a couple of novel properties: local encodability and rateless-ness. Local encodability is the property that each block of the encoding of a message can be computed independently from the others in constant time. This also implies that each encoding block is only dependent on a constant-sized part of the message and a few preprocessed bits. Rateless-ness is the property that each message has an encoding of practically infinite size. We argue that rateless codes are more appropriate than fixed-rate codes for most situations where erasure codes were considered a solution. Furthermore, rateless codes meet new areas of application, where they are not replaceable by fixed-rate codes. One such area is information dispersal over peer-to-peer networks.},

Trust relationships and routing decisions are based on experienced, observed, or reported routing and forwarding behavior of other nodes. The detailed implementation of CONFIDANT in this paper assumes that the network layer is based on the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol. We present a performance analysis of DSR fortified by CONFIDANT and compare it to regular defenseless DSR. It shows that a network with CONFIDANT and up to 60\% of misbehaving nodes behaves almost as well as a benign network, in sharp contrast to a defenseless network. All simulations have been implemented and performed in GloMoSim.},

A feature that significantly contributes to the success of many P2P applications is user anonymity. However, anonymity opens the door to possible misuses and abuses, exploiting the P2P network as a way to spread tampered with resources, including Trojan Horses, viruses, and spam. To address this problem we propose a self-regulating system where the P2P network is used to implement a robust reputation mechanism. Reputation sharing is realized through a distributed polling algorithm by which resource requestors can assess the reliability of a resource offered by a participant before initiating the download. This way, spreading of malicious contents will be reduced and eventually blocked. Our approach can be straightforwardly piggybacked on existing P2P protocols and requires modest modifications to current implementations.},

  abstract     = {A Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol allows a user to retrieve a data item of its choice from a database, such that the servers storing the database do not gain information on the identity of the item being retrieved. PIR protocols were studied in depth since the subject was introduced in Chor, Goldreich, Kushilevitz, and Sudan 1995. The standard definition of PIR protocols raises a simple question - what happens if some of the servers crash during the operation? How can we devise a protocol which still works in the presence of crashing servers? Current systems do not guarantee availability of servers at all times for many reasons, e.g., crash of server or communication problems. Our purpose is to design robust PIR protocols, i.e., protocols which still work correctly even if only k out of l servers are available during the protocols{\textquoteright} operation (the user does not know in advance which servers are available). We present various robust PIR protocols giving different tradeofis between the different parameters. These protocols are incomparable, i.e., for different values of n and k we will get better results using different protocols. We first present a generic transformation from regular PIR protocols to robust PIR protocols, this transformation is important since any improvement in the communication complexity of regular PIR protocol will immediately implicate improvement in the robust PIR protocol communication. We also present two specific robust PIR protocols. Finally, we present robust PIR protocols which can tolerate Byzantine servers, i.e., robust PIR protocols which still work in the presence of malicious servers or servers with corrupted or obsolete databases.},

Our results show that for groups of size 32 or more, our protocol has lower link stress (by about 25\%), improved or similar end-to-end latencies and similar failure recovery properties. More importantly, it is able to achieve these results by using orders of magnitude lower control traffic.Finally, we present results from our wide-area testbed in which we experimented with 32-100 member groups distributed over 8 different sites. In our experiments, average group members established and maintained low-latency paths and incurred a maximum packet loss rate of less than 1\% as members randomly joined and left the multicast group. The average control overhead during our experiments was less than 1 Kbps for groups of size 100.},

Scribe provides best-effort reliability guarantees, but we outline how an application can extend Scribe to provide stronger reliability.

This process excludes entire names by mapping the set of allowed strings to the set of all strings, excludes certain characters through an amended prefix encoding, excludes terminal characters through varying the prefix coding by character index, and supports case-insensitive comparison of names by extracting and encrypting case information separately. We also address the issues of hiding name-length information and access-authorization information, and we report a newly discovered problem with enforcing case-insensitive uniqueness for Unicode names.},

These overlays are highly resilient; they can route messages correctly even when a large fraction of the nodes crash or the network partitions. But current overlays are not secure; even a small fraction of malicious nodes can prevent correct message delivery throughout the overlay. This problem is particularly serious in open peer-to-peer systems, where many diverse, autonomous parties without preexisting trust relationships wish to pool their resources. This paper studies attacks aimed at preventing correct message delivery in structured peer-to-peer overlays and presents defenses to these attacks. We describe and evaluate techniques that allow nodes to join the overlay, to maintain routing state, and to forward messages securely in the presence of malicious nodes.

However, current schemes based upon consistent hashing require both considerable implementation complexity and substantial storage overhead to achieve desired load balancing goals. We argue in this paper that these goals can be achieved more simply and more cost-effectively. First, we suggest the direct application of the power of two choices paradigm, whereby an item is stored at the less loaded of two (or more) random alternatives. We then consider how associating a small constant number of hash values with a key can naturally be extended to support other load balancing strategies, including load-stealing or load-shedding, as well as providing natural fault-tolerance mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new approach to securing self-organized mobile ad hoc networks. In this approach, security is achieved in a fully self-organized manner; by this we mean that the security system does not require any kind of certification authority or centralized server, even for the initialization phase. In our work, we were inspired by PGP [15] because its operation relies solely on the acquaintances between users. We show that the small-world phenomenon naturally emerges in the PGP system as a consequence of the self-organization of users. We show this by studying the PGP certificate graph properties and by quantifying its small-world characteristics. We argue that the certificate graphs of self-organized security systems will exhibit a similar small-world phenomenon, and we provide a way to model self-organized certificate graphs. The results of the PGP certificate graph analysis and graph modelling can be used to build new self-organized security systems and to test the performance of the existing proposals. In this work, we refer to such an example.},

  abstract  = {Software merging is an essential aspect of the maintenance and evolution of large-scale software systems. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and analysis of available merge approaches. Over the years, a wide variety of different merge techniques has been proposed. While initial techniques were purely based on textual merging, more powerful approaches also take the syntax and semantics of the software into account. There is a tendency towards operation-based merging because of its increased expressiveness. Another tendency is to try to define merge techniques that are as general, accurate, scalable, and customizable as possible, so that they can be used in any phase in the software life-cycle and detect as many conflicts as possible. After comparing the possible merge techniques, we suggest a number of important open problems and future research directions.

This allows for a variety of applications beyond simple file sharing. Examples include multicast systems, anonymous communications systems, and web caches. We survey security issues that occur in the underlying p2p routing protocols, as well as fairness and trust issues that occur in file sharing and other p2p applications. We discuss how techniques, ranging from cryptography, to random network probing, to economic incentives, can be used to address these problems.},

Checkpointing can be coordinated, uncoordinated, or communication-induced. Log-based protocols combine checkpointing with logging of nondeterministic events, encoded in tuples called determinants. Depending on how determinants are logged, log-based protocols can be pessimistic, optimistic, or causal. Throughout the survey, we highlight the research issues that are at the core of rollback-recovery and present the solutions that currently address them. We also compare the performance of different rollback-recovery protocols with respect to a series of desirable properties and discuss the issues that arise in the practical implementations of these protocols. },

A message initiator chooses a path of peers pseudo-randomly through a restricted topology in a way that adversaries cannot easily influence. Cover traffic prevents a global observer from using traffic analysis to identify an initiator. Protocols toward unbiased peer-selection offer new directions for distributing trust among untrusted entities.Tarzan provides anonymity to either clients or servers, without requiring that both participate. In both cases, Tarzan uses a network address translator (NAT) to bridge between Tarzan hosts and oblivious Internet hosts.Measurements show that Tarzan imposes minimal overhead over a corresponding non-anonymous overlay route.},

Yet little is known about the frequency of misconfiguration or its causes, except for the few spectacular incidents of widespread outages. In this paper, we present the first quantitative study of BGP misconfiguration. Over a three week period, we analyzed routing table advertisements from 23 vantage points across the Internet backbone to detect incidents of misconfiguration. For each incident we polled the ISP operators involved to verify whether it was a misconfiguration, and to learn the cause of the incident. We also actively probed the Internet to determine the impact of misconfiguration on connectivity.Surprisingly, we find that configuration errors are pervasive, with 200-1200 prefixes (0.2-1.0\% of the BGP table size) suffering from misconfiguration each day. Close to 3 in 4 of all new prefix advertisements were results of misconfiguration. Fortunately, the connectivity seen by end users is surprisingly robust to misconfigurations. While misconfigurations can substantially increase the update load on routers, only one in twenty five affects connectivity. While the causes of misconfiguration are diverse, we argue that most could be prevented through better router design.},

The direct migration problem is closely related to edge-coloring. However, because there are space constraints on the devices, the problem is more complex. Our main results are polynomial time algorithms for finding a near-optimal migration plan in the presence of space constraints when a certain number of additional nodes is available as temporary storage, and a 3/2-approximation for the case where data must be migrated directly to its destination.},

  abstract     = {Most currently proposed solutions to application-level multicast organise the group members into an application-level mesh over which a Distance-Vector routingp rotocol, or a similar algorithm, is used to construct source-rooted distribution trees. The use of a global routing protocol limits the scalability of these systems. Other proposed solutions that scale to larger numbers of receivers do so by restricting the multicast service model to be single-sourced. In this paper, we propose an application-level multicast scheme capable of scaling to large group sizes without restrictingthe service model to a single source. Our scheme builds on recent work on Content-Addressable Networks (CANs). Extendingthe CAN framework to support multicast comes at trivial additional cost and, because of the structured nature of CAN topologies, obviates the need for a multicast routingalg orithm. Given the deployment of a distributed infrastructure such as a CAN, we believe our CAN-based multicast scheme offers the dual advantages of simplicity and scalability.},

This paper presents mechanisms that protect individual privacy while presenting accurate-indeed authenticated-profile information to servers and merchants. In particular, we give a pseudonym registration scheme and system that enforces unique user registration while separating trust required of registrars, issuers, and validators. This scheme enables the issuance of global unique pseudonyms (GUPs) and attributes enabling practical applications such as authentication of accurate attributes and enforcement of {\textquotedblleft}one-to-a-customer{\textquotedblright} properties.
We also present a scheme resilient to even pseudonymous profiling yet preserving the ability of merchants to authenticate the accuracy of information. It is the first mechanism of which the authors are aware to guarantee recent validity for group signatures, and more generally multi-group signatures, thus effectively enabling revocation of all or some of the multi-group certificates held by a principal.

This paper outlines a design for a peer-to-peer, scalable, tamper-resilient communication protocol that provides strong anonymity and privacy. Called CliqueNet, our protocol provides an information-theoretic guarantee: an omnipotent adversary that can wiretap at any location in the network cannot determine the sender of a packet beyond a clique, that is, a set of k hosts, where k is an anonymizing factor chosen by the participants. CliqueNet is resilient to jamming by malicious hosts and can scale with the number of participants. This paper motivates the need for an anonymous communication layer and describes the self-organizing, novel divide-and-conquer approach that enables CliqueNet to scale while offering a strong anonymity guarantee. CliqueNet is widely applicable as a communication substrate for peer-to-peer applications that require anonymity, privacy and anti-censorship guarantees.},

Recent advances in hardware and communication technologies have made possible and cost e ective to share a file system among several machines over a local (but possibly also a wide) area network. One of the most successful and widely used such applications is Sun{\textquoteright}s Network File System (NFS). NFS is very simple in structure but assumes a very strong trust model: the user trusts the remote le system server (which might be running on a machine in di erent country) and a network with his/her data. It is easy to see that neither assumption is a very realistic one. The server (or anybody with superuser privileges) might very well read the data on its local lesytem and it is well known that the Internet or any local area network (e.g, Ethernet) is very easy to tap (see for example, Berkeley{\textquoteright}s tcpdump 7, 5] application program). Impersoni cation of users is also another security drawback of NFS. In fact, most of the permission checking over NFS are performed in the kernel of the client. In such a context a pirate can temporarely assign to his own workstation the Internet address of victim. Without secure RPC 9] no further authentication procedure is requested. From here on, the pirate can issue NFS requests presenting himself with any (false) uid and therefore accessing for reading and writing any private data on the server, even protected data.
Given the above, a user seeking a certain level of security should take some measures. Possible solutions are to use either user-level cryptography or application level cryptography. A discussion of the drawbacks of these approaches is found in 4]. A better approach is to push encryption services into the operating system as done by M. Blaze in the design of his CFS 4].
In this paper, we propose a new cryptographic le system, which we call TCFS , as a suitable solution to the problem of privacy for distributed le system (see section 2.1). Our work improves on CFS by providing a deeper integration between the encryption service and the le system which results in a complete transparency of use to the user applications.

By carefully designing these graphs we can construct for any given rate R and any given real number ε a family of linear codes of rate R which can be encoded in time proportional to ln(1/ε) times their block length n. Furthermore, a codeword can be recovered with high probability from a portion of its entries of length (1+ε)Rn or more. The recovery algorithm also runs in time proportional to n ln(1/ε).

In this paper we propose a practical anonymous credential system that is based on the strong RSA assumption and the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption modulo a safe prime product and is considerably superior to existing ones: 1 We give the first practical solution that allows a user to unlinkably demonstrate possession of a credential as many times as necessary without involving the issuing organization. 2 To prevent misuse of anonymity, our scheme is the first to offer optional anonymity revocation for particular transactions. 3 Our scheme offers separability: all organizations can choose their cryptographic keys independently of each other. Moreover, we suggest more effective means of preventing users from sharing their credentials, by introducing all-or-nothing sharing: a user who allows a friend to use one of her credentials once, gives him the ability to use all of her credentials, i.e., taking over her identity. This is implemented by a new primitive, called circular encryption, which is of independent interest, and can be realized from any semantically secure cryptosystem in the random oracle model.},

We then show how these building blocks can be used for applying the scheme to efficient electronic voting.This reduces dramatically the work needed to compute the final result of an election, compared to the previously best known schemes.W e show how the basic scheme for a yes/no vote can be easily adapted to casting a vote for up to t out of L candidates.

For example, using belief propagation, for rate I R codes on 16 000 bits over a binary-symmetric channel, previous low-density parity-check codes can correct up to approximately 16 \% errors, while our codes correct over 17\%.

  abstract  = {A Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol enables a user to retrieve a data item from a database while hiding the identity of the item being retrieved. In a t-private, k-server PIR protocol the database is replicated among k servers, and the user{\textquoteright}s privacy is protected from any collusion of up to t servers. The main cost-measure of such protocols is the communication complexity of retrieving a single bit of data.
This work addresses the information-theoretic setting for PIR, in which the user{\textquoteright}s privacy should be unconditionally protected from collusions of servers. We present a unified general construction, whose abstract components can be instantiated to yield both old and new families of PIR protocols. A main ingredient in the new protocols is a generalization of a solution by Babai, Kimmel, and Lokam to a communication complexity problem in the so-called simultaneous messages model.
Our construction strictly improves upon previous constructions and resolves some previous anomalies. In particular, we obtain: (1) t-private k-server PIR protocols with O(n 1/⌊ (2k-1)/tc⌋) communication bits, where n is the database size. For t > 1, this is a substantial asymptotic improvement over the previous state of the art; (2) a constant-factor improvement in the communication complexity of 1-private PIR, providing the first improvement to the 2-server case since PIR protocols were introduced; (3) efficient PIR protocols with logarithmic query length. The latter protocols have applications to the construction of efficient families of locally decodable codes over large alphabets and to PIR protocols with reduced work by the servers.},

This paper describes a series of experiments which obtained detailed measurements of the energy consumption of an IEEE 802.11 wireless network interface operating in an ad hoc networking environment. The data is presented as a collection of linear equations for calculating the energy consumed in sending, receiving and discarding broadcast and point-to-point data packets of various sizes.

  abstract     = {Users rarely consider running network file systems over slow or wide-area networks, as the performance would be unacceptable and the bandwidth consumption too high. Nonetheless, efficient remote file access would often be desirable over such networks---particularly when high latency makes remote login sessions unresponsive. Rather than run interactive programs such as editors remotely, users could run the programs locally and manipulate remote files through the file system. To do so, however, would require a network file system that consumes less bandwidth than most current file systems.This paper presents LBFS, a network file system designed for low-bandwidth networks. LBFS exploits similarities between files or versions of the same file to save bandwidth. It avoids sending data over the network when the same data can already be found in the server{\textquoteright}s file system or the client{\textquoteright}s cache. Using this technique in conjunction with conventional compression and caching, LBFS consumes over an order of magnitude less bandwidth than traditional network file systems on common workloads.},

The total number of bits broadcast is O(nk|C|),where k is the security parameter and |C| is the size of a (Boolean) circuit computing the function to be securely evaluated. An earlier proposal by Franklin and Haber with the same complexity was only secure for passive adversaries,while all earlier protocols with active security had complexity at least quadratic in n.

It can be used to support a variety of peer-to-peer applications, including global data
storage, data sharing, group communication and naming. Each node in the Pastry network has a unique identifier (nodeId). When presented with a message and a key, a Pastry node efficiently routes the message to the node with a nodeId that is numerically closest to the key, among all currently live Pastry nodes. Each Pastry node keeps track of its immediate neighbors in the nodeId space, and notifies applications of new node arrivals, node failures and recoveries. Pastry takes into account network locality; it seeks to minimize the distance messages travel, according to a to scalar proximity metric like the number of IP routing hops.
Pastry is completely decentralized, scalable, and self-organizing; it automatically adapts to the arrival, departure and failure of nodes. Experimental results obtained with a prototype implementation on an emulated network of up to 100,000 nodes confirm Pastry{\textquoteright}s scalability and efficiency, its ability to self-organize and adapt to node failures, and its good network locality properties.},

  abstract     = {Upstart software projects Napster, Gnutella, and Freenet have dominated newspaper headlines, challenging traditional approaches to content distribution with their revolutionary use of peer-to-peer file-sharing technologies. Reporters try to sort out the ramifications of seemingly ungoverned peer-to-peer networks. Lawyers, business leaders, and social commentators debate the virtues and evils of these bold new distributed systems. But what{\textquoteright}s really behind such disruptive technologies -- the breakthrough innovations that have rocked the music and media worlds? And what lies ahead?
In this book, key peer-to-peer pioneers take us beyond the headlines and hype and show how the technology is changing the way we communicate and exchange information. Those working to advance peer-to-peer as a technology, a business opportunity, and an investment offer their insights into how the technology has evolved and where it{\textquoteright}s going. They explore the problems they{\textquoteright}ve faced, the solutions they{\textquoteright}ve discovered, the lessons they{\textquoteright}ve learned, and their goals for the future of computer networking.

Until now, Internet communities have been limited by the flat interactive qualities of email and network newsgroups, where people can exchange recommendations and ideas but have great difficulty commenting on one another{\textquoteright}s postings, structuring information, performing searches, and creating summaries. Peer-to-peer challenges the traditional authority of the client/server model, allowing shared information to reside instead with producers and users. Peer-to-peer networks empower users to collaborate on producing and consuming information, adding to it, commenting on it, and building communities around it.

This compilation represents the collected wisdom of today{\textquoteright}s peer-to-peer luminaries. It includes contributions from Gnutella{\textquoteright}s Gene Kan, Freenet{\textquoteright}s Brandon Wiley, Jabber{\textquoteright}s Jeremie Miller, and many others -- plus serious discussions of topics ranging from accountability and trust to security and performance. Fraught with questions and promise, peer-to-peer is sure to remain on the computer industry{\textquoteright}s center stage for years to come.},

On top of this reliability, pStore includes support for file encryption, versioning, and secure sharing. Its custom versioning system permits arbitrary version retrieval similar to CVS. pStore provides this functionality at less than 10\% of the network bandwidth and requires 85\% less storage capacity than simpler local tape backup schemes for a representative workload.},

  abstract  = {A Resilient Overlay Network (RON) is an architecture that allows distributed Internet applications to detect and recover from path outages and periods of degraded performance within several seconds, improving over today{\textquoteright}s wide-area routing protocols that take at least several minutes to recover. A RON is an application-layer overlay on top of the existing Internet routing substrate. The RON nodes monitor the functioning and quality of the Internet paths among themselves, and use this information to decide whether to route packets directly over the Internet or by way of other RON nodes, optimizing application-specific routing metrics.Results from two sets of measurements of a working RON deployed at sites scattered across the Internet demonstrate the benefits of our architecture. For instance, over a 64-hour sampling period in March 2001 across a twelve-node RON, there were 32 significant outages, each lasting over thirty minutes, over the 132 measured paths. RON{\textquoteright}s routing mechanism was able to detect, recover, and route around all of them, in less than twenty seconds on average, showing that its methods for fault detection and recovery work well at discovering alternate paths in the Internet. Furthermore, RON was able to improve the loss rate, latency, or throughput perceived by data transfers; for example, about 5\% of the transfers doubled their TCP throughput and 5\% of our transfers saw their loss probability reduced by 0.05. We found that forwarding packets via at most one intermediate RON node is sufficient to overcome faults and improve performance in most cases. These improvements, particularly in the area of fault detection and recovery, demonstrate the benefits of moving some of the control over routing into the hands of end-systems.},

  abstract  = {Data transfer over TCP/IP provides no privacy for network users. Previous research in anonymity has focused on the provision of initiator anonymity. We explore methods of adapting existing initiator-anonymous protocols to provide responder anonymity and mutual anonymity. We present Anonymous Peer-to-peer File Sharing (APFS) protocols, which provide mutual anonymity for peer-topeer le sharing. APFS addresses the problem of longlived Internet services that may outlive the degradation present in current anonymous protocols. One variant of APFS makes use of unicast communication, but requires a central coordinator to bootstrap the protocol. A second variant takes advantage of multicast routing to remove the need for any central coordination point. We compare the TCP performance of APFS protocol to existing overt le sharing systems such as Napster. In providing anonymity, APFS can double transfer times and requires that additional trac be carried by peers, but this overhead is constant with the size of the session. 1},

  abstract  = {We consider the problems of societal norms for cooperation and reputation when it is possible to obtain cheap pseudonyms, something that is becoming quite common in a wide variety of interactions on the Internet. This introduces opportunities to misbehave without paying reputational consequences. A large degree of cooperation can still emerge, through a convention in which newcomers "pay their dues" by accepting poor treatment from players who have established positive reputations. One might hope for an open society where newcomers are treated well, but there is an inherent social cost in making the spread of reputations optional. We prove that no equilibrium can sustain significantly more cooperation than the dues-paying equilibrium in a repeated random matching game with a large number of players in which players have finite lives and the ability to change their identities, and there is a small but nonvanishing probability of mistakes. Although one could remove the inefficiency of mistreating newcomers by disallowing anonymity, this is not practical or desirable in a wide variety of transactions. We discuss the use of entry fees, which permits newcomers to be trusted but excludes some players with low payoffs, thus introducing a different inefficiency. We also discuss the use of free but unreplaceable pseudonyms, and describe a mechanism that implements them using standard encryption techniques, which could be practically implemented in electronic transactions.},

  abstract     = {Economics has much to do with incentives--not least, incentives to work hard, to produce quality products, to study, to invest, and to save. Although Adam Smith amply confirmed this more than two hundred years ago in his analysis of sharecropping contracts, only in recent decades has a theory begun to emerge to place the topic at the heart of economic thinking. In this book, Jean-Jacques Laffont and David Martimort present the most thorough yet accessible introduction to incentives theory to date. Central to this theory is a simple question as pivotal to modern-day management as it is to economics research: What makes people act in a particular way in an economic or business situation? In seeking an answer, the authors provide the methodological tools to design institutions that can ensure good incentives for economic agents.

This book focuses on the principal-agent model, the "simple" situation where a principal, or company, delegates a task to a single agent through a contract--the essence of management and contract theory. How does the owner or manager of a firm align the objectives of its various members to maximize profits? Following a brief historical overview showing how the problem of incentives has come to the fore in the past two centuries, the authors devote the bulk of their work to exploring principal-agent models and various extensions thereof in light of three types of information problems: adverse selection, moral hazard, and non-verifiability. Offering an unprecedented look at a subject vital to industrial organization, labor economics, and behavioral economics, this book is set to become the definitive resource for students, researchers, and others who might find themselves pondering what contracts, and the incentives they embody, are really all about.},

The output of the shuffle operation is another sequence of k modular integers, each of which is the same secret power of a corresponding input element, but the order of elements in the output is kept secret. Though it is a trivial matter for the "shuffler" (who chooses the permutation of the elements to be applied) to compute the output from the input, the construction is important because it provides a linear size proof of correctness for the output sequence (i.e. a proof that it is of the form claimed) that can be checked by an arbitrary verifiers. The complexity of the protocol improves on that of Furukawa-Sako[16] both measured by number of exponentiations and by overall size.The protocol is shown to be honest-verifier zeroknowledge in a special case, and is computational zeroknowledge in general. On the way to the final result, we also construct a generalization of the well known Chaum-Pedersen protocol for knowledge of discrete logarithm equality [10], [7]. In fact, the generalization specializes exactly to the Chaum-Pedersen protocol in the case k = 2. This result may be of interest on its own.An application to electronic voting is given that matches the features of the best current protocols with significant efficiency improvements. An alternative application to electronic voting is also given that introduces an entirely new paradigm for achieving Universally Verifiable elections.},

It stores collections of source files, keeps track of which versions of which files go together, and automates the process of building a complete software artifact from its component pieces. Vesta{\textquoteright}s novel approach gives it three important properties. First, every build is repeatable, because its component sources and build tools are stored immutably and immortally, and its configuration description completely specifies what components and tools are used and how they are put together. Second, every build is incremental, because results of previous builds are cached and reused. Third, every build is consistent, because all build dependencies are automatically captured and recorded, so that a cached result from a previous build is reused only when doing so is certain to be correct. In addition, Vesta{\textquoteright}s flexible language for writing configuration descriptions makes it easy to describe large software configurations in a modular fashion and to create variant configurations by customizing build parameters. This paper gives a brief overview of Vesta, outlining Vesta{\textquoteright}s advantages over traditional tools, how those benefits are achieved, and the system{\textquoteright}s overall performance.},

CFS does this with a completely decentralized architecture that can scale to large systems. CFS servers provide a distributed hash table (DHash) for block storage. CFS clients interpret DHash blocks as a file system. DHash distributes and caches blocks at a fine granularity to achieve load balance, uses replication for robustness, and decreases latency with server selection. DHash finds blocks using the Chord location protocol, which operates in time logarithmic in the number of servers.CFS is implemented using the SFS file system toolkit and runs on Linux, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD. Experience on a globally deployed prototype shows that CFS delivers data to clients as fast as FTP. Controlled tests show that CFS is scalable: with 4,096 servers, looking up a block of data involves contacting only seven servers. The tests also demonstrate nearly perfect robustness and unimpaired performance even when as many as half the servers fail.},

It is believed that mechanisms such as anonymity and pseudonymity are essential building blocks in formulating solutions to address these challenges and considerable effort has been devoted towards realizing these primitives in practice. The focus of this effort, however, has mostly been on hiding explicit identify information (such as source addresses) by employing a combination of anonymizing proxies, cryptographic techniques to distribute trust among them and traffic shaping techniques to defeat traffic analysis. We claim that such approaches ignore a significant amount of identifying information about the source that leaks from the contents of web traffic itself. In this paper, we demonstrate the significance and value of such information by showing how techniques from linguistics and stylometry can use this information to compromise pseudonymity in several important settings. We discuss the severity of this problem and suggest possible countermeasures.},

However, ten years after its initial proposal, IP Multicast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability, network management, deployment and support for higher layer functionality such as error, flow and congestion control. In this paper, we explore an alternative architecture for small and sparse groups, where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membership management and packet replication. We call such a scheme End System Multicast. This shifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with IP Multicast. However, the key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a model. In particular, End System Multicast introduces duplicate packets on physical links and incurs larger end-to-end delay than IP Multicast. In this paper, we study this question in the context of the Narada protocol. In Narada, end systems self-organize into an overlay structure using a fully distributed protocol. In addition, Narada attempts to optimize the efficiency of the overlay based on end-to-end measurements. We present details of Narada and evaluate it using both simulation and Internet experiments. Preliminary results are encouraging. In most simulations and Internet experiments, the delay and bandwidth penalty are low. We believe the potential benefits of repartitioning multicast functionality between end systems and routers significantly outweigh the performance penalty incurred.},

We{\textquoteright}ll show that some additional attacks are possible in networks with freely chosen MIX routes. After describing these attacks, we estimate their impact on the achievable degree of anonymity. Finally, we evaluate the relevance of the described attacks with respect to existing systems like e.g. Mixmaster, Crowds, and Freedom.},

  abstract     = {Wireless distributed micro-sensor systems will enable the reliable monitoring of a variety of environments for both civil and military applications. In this paper, we look at communication protocols, which can have significant impact on the overall energy dissipation of these networks.Based on our findings that the conventional protocols of direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multihop routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for sensor networks, we propose LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based protocol that utilizes randomized rotation of local cluster base stations (cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network. LEACH uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic net-works, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. Simulations show that LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional routing protocols. In addition, LEACH is able to distribute energy dissipation evenly throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system lifetime for the networks we simulated.},

FSR introduces the notion of multi-level fisheye scope to reduce routing update overhead in large networks. Nodes exchange link state entries with their neighbors with a frequency which depends on distance to destination. From link state entries, nodes construct the topology map of the entire network and compute optimal routes. Simulation experiments show that FSR is simple, efficient and scalable routing solution in a mobile, ad hoc environment. 1 Introduction As the wireless and embedded computing technologies continue to advance, increasing numbers of small size and high performance computing and communication devices will be capable of tetherless communications and ad hoc wireless networking. An ad hoc wireless network is a selforganizing and self-configuring network with the capability of rapid deployment in response to application needs.},

One can also add robustness i.e. it outputs correct results in the presence of corrupt servers.

Onion Routing{\textquoteright}s anonymous connections are bidirectional and near real-time, and can be used anywhere a socket connection can be used. Proxy aware applications, such as web browsing and e-mail, require no modification to use Onion Routing, and do so through a series of proxies. Other applications, such as remote login, can also use the system without modification. Access to an onion routing network can be configured in a variety of ways depending on the needs, policies, and facilities of those connecting. This paper describes some of these access configurations and also provides a basic overview of Onion Routing and comparisons with related work.},

These properties stem from Overcast{\textquoteright}s implementation as an overlay network. An overlay network consists of a collection of nodes placed at strategic locations in an existing network fabric. These nodes implement a network abstraction on top of the network provided by the underlying substrate network.

Overcast provides scalable and reliable single-source multicast using a simple protocol for building efficient data distribution trees that adapt to changing network conditions. To support fast joins, Overcast implements a new protocol for efficiently tracking the global status of a changing distribution tree.

Results based on simulations confirm that Overcast provides its added functionality while performing competitively with IP Multicast. Simulations indicate that Overcast quickly builds bandwidth-efficient distribution trees that, compared to IP Multicast, provide 70\%-100\% of the total bandwidth possible, at a cost of somewhat less than twice the network load. In addition, Overcast adapts quickly to changes caused by the addition of new nodes or the failure of existing nodes without causing undue load on the multicast source.},

  abstract     = {Long a matter of folklore, the {\textquotedblleft}small-world phenomenon {\textquotedblright} {\textemdash} the principle that we are all linked by short chains of acquaintances {\textemdash} was inaugurated as an area of experimental study in the social sciences through the pioneering work of Stanley Milgram in the 1960{\textquoteright}s. This work was among the first to make the phenomenon quantitative, allowing people to speak of the {\textquotedblleft}six degrees of separation {\textquotedblright} between any two people in the United States. Since then, a number of network models have been proposed as frameworks in which to study the problem analytically. One of the most refined of these models was formulated in recent work of Watts and Strogatz; their framework provided compelling evidence that the small-world phenomenon is pervasive in a range of networks arising in nature and technology, and a fundamental ingredient in the evolution of the World Wide Web. But existing models are insufficient to explain the striking algorithmic component of Milgram{\textquoteright}s original findings: that individuals using local information are collectively very effective at actually constructing short paths between two points in a social network. Although recently proposed network models are rich in short paths, we prove that no decentralized algorithm, operating with local information only, can construct short paths in these networks with non-negligible probability. We then define an infinite family of network models that naturally generalizes the Watts-Strogatz model, and show that for one of these models, there is a decentralized algorithm capable of finding short paths with high probability. More generally, we provide a strong characterization of this family of network models, showing that there is in fact a unique model within the family for which decentralized algorithms are effective.},

This exposition presents a model to formally study such algorithms.

Using this model, we demonstrate how some of the techniques of mechanism design can be applied towards distributed computation problems. We then exhibit some issues that arise in distributed computation which require going beyond the existing theory of mechanism design.},

It also uses Tcl for the creation of the user interface, giving the system administrator great flexibility in customizing the system. Burt supports parallel backups to ensure high backup speeds, and checksums to ensure data integrity. The principal contribution of Burt is that it provides a powerful I/O engine within the context of a flexible scripting language; this combination enables graceful solutions to many problems associated with backups of large installations.

We argue that this behavior is a relic of the past, when disk storage was a scarce resource. Today, large cheap disks make it possible for the file system to protect valuable data from accidental delete or overwrite. This paper describes the design, implementation, and performance of the Elephant file system, which automatically retains all important versions of user files. Users name previous file versions by combining a traditional pathname with a time when the desired version of a file or directory existed. Storage in Elephant is managed by the system using filegrain user-specified retention policies. This approach contrasts with checkpointing file systems such as Plan-9, AFS, and WAFL that periodically generate efficient checkpoints of entire file systems and thus restrict retention to be guided by a single policy for all files within that file system. Elephant is implemented as a new Virtual File System in the FreeBSD kernel.},

In particular, we believe that localized algorithms (in which simple local node behavior achieves a desired global objective) may be necessary for sensor network coordination. In this paper, we describe localized algorithms, and then discuss directed diffusion, a simple communication model for describing localized algorithms.},

  abstract  = {this article{\textquoteright}s publication, the prototype network is processing more than 1 million Web connections per month from more than six thousand IP addresses in twenty countries and in all six main top level domains. [7] Onion Routing operates by dynamically building anonymous connections within a network of real-time Chaum Mixes [3]. A Mix is a store and forward device that accepts a number of fixed-length messages from numerous sources, performs cryptographic transformations on the messages, and then forwards the messages to the next destination in a random order. A single Mix makes tracking of a particular message either by specific bit-pattern, size, or ordering with respect to other messages difficult. By routing through numerous Mixes in the network, determining who is talking to whom becomes even more difficult. Onion Routing{\textquoteright}s network of core onion-routers (Mixes) is distributed, faulttolerant, and under the control of multiple administrative domains, so no single onion-router can bring down the network or compromise a user{\textquoteright}s privacy, and cooperation between compromised onion-routers is thereby confounded.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we describe a technique called operation-based update propagation for efficiently transmitting updates to large files that have been modified on a weakly connected client of a distributed file system. In this technique, modifications are captured above the file-system layer at the client, shipped to a surrogate client that is strongly connected to a server, re-executed at the surrogate, and the resulting files transmitted from the surrogate to the server. If re-execution fails to produce a file identical to the original, the system falls back to shipping the file from the client over the slow network. We have implemented a prototype of this mechanism in the Coda File System on Linux, and demonstrated performance improvements ranging from 40 percents to nearly three orders of magnitude in reduced network traffic and elapsed time. We also found a novel use of forward error correction in this context.

Onions themselves appear differently to each onion router as well as to network observers. The same goes for data carried over the connections they establish.

  abstract     = {Private information retrieval (PIR) schemes provide a user with information from a database while keeping his query secret from the database manager. We propose a new model for PIR, utilizing auxiliary random servers providing privacy services for database access. The principal database initially engages in a preprocessing setup computation with the random servers, followed by the on-line stage with the users. Using this model we achieve the first PIR information theoretic solutions in which the database does not need to give away its data to be replicated, and with minimal on-line computation cost for the database. This solves privacy and efficiency problems inherent to all previous solutions. Specifically, in all previously existing PIR schemes the database on-line computation for one query is at least linear in the size of the data, and all previous information theoretic schemes require multiple replications of the database which are not allowed to communicate with each other.This poses a privacy problem for the database manager, who is required to hand his data to multiple foreign entities, and to the user, who is supposed to trust the multiple copies of the database not to communicate. In contrast, in our solutions no replication is needed, and the database manager only needs to perform O(1) amount of computation to answer questions of users, while all the extra computations required on line for privacy are done by the auxiliary random servers, who contain no information about the data.},

If verification of user identities is not possible due to the related management overhead or a general lack of information (e.g. on the Internet), an adversary can participate several times in a communication relationship and observe the honest users. In this paper we focus on the problem of providing anonymity without identity verification. The notion of probabilistic anonymity is introduced. Probabilistic anonymity is based on a publicly known security parameter, which determines the security of the protocol. For probabilistic anonymity the insecurity, expressed as the probability of having only one honest participant, approaches 0 at an exponential rate as the security parameter is changed linearly. Based on our security model we propose a new MIX variant called {\textquotedblleft}Stop-and-Go-MIX{\textquotedblright} (SG-MIX) which provides anonymity without identity verification, and prove that it is probabilistically secure.},

Today, the best two database scheme (k = 2) has communication complexity O(n 1=3 ), while for any constant number, k, the best k database scheme has communication complexity O(n 1=(2k\Gamma1) ). The motivation for the present work is the question whether this complexity can be reduced if one is willing to achieve computational privacy, rather than information theoretic privacy.

We expect these codes will be extremely useful for applications such as real-time audio and video transmission over the Internet, where lossy channels are common and fast decoding is a requirement. Despite the simplicity of the algorithms, their design and analysis are mathematically intricate. The design requires the careful choice of a random irregular bipartite graph, where the structure of the irregular graph is extremely important. We model the progress of the decoding algorithm by a set of differential equations. The solution to these equations can then be expressed as polynomials in one variable with coefficients determined by the graph structure. Based on these polynomials, we design a graph structure that guarantees successful decoding with high probability.},

The algorithms of this framework are efficient, robust, and scale well to both very large networks and very large sessions. The SRM framework has been prototyped in wb, a distributed whiteboard application, which has been used on a global scale with sessions ranging from a few to a few hundred participants. The paper describes the principles that have guided the SRM design, including the IP multicast group delivery model, an end-to-end, receiver-based model of reliability, and the application level framing protocol model. As with unicast communications, the performance of a reliable multicast delivery algorithm depends on the underlying topology and operational environment. We investigate that dependence via analysis and simulation, and demonstrate an adaptive algorithm that uses the results of previous loss recovery events to adapt the control parameters used
for future loss recovery. With the adaptive algorithm, our reliable multicast delivery algorithm provides good performance over a wide range of underlying topologies.},

It is especially useless if the two parties concerned did not have the foresight to obtain such certificates before desiring to open a secure channel. There are many methods for establishing identity without using certificates from trusted certification authorities. The relationship between verifier and subject guides the choice of method. Many of these relationships have easy, straight-forward methods for binding a public key to an identity, using a broadcast channel or 1:1 meetings, but one relationship makes it especially difficult. That relationship is one with an old friend with whom you had lost touch but who appears now to be available on the net. You make contact and share a few exchanges which suggest to you that this is, indeed, your old friend. Then you want to form a secure channel in order to carry on a more extensive conversation in private. This case is subject to the man-in-themiddle attack. For this case, a protocol is presented which binds a pair of identities to a pair of public keys without using any certificates issued by a trusted CA. The apparent direct conflict between conventional wisdom and the thesis of this paper lies in the definition of the word "identity" -- a word which is commonly left undefined in discussions of certification.},

Specically, the architecture provides for bi-directional communication even though no-one but the initiator{\textquoteright}s proxy server knows anything but previous and next hops
in the communication chain. This implies that neither the respondent nor his proxy server nor any external observer need know the identity of the initiator or his proxy server.

That is, unlike in the single site case, balance in the sense that the tree height satisfies a logarithmic upper bound cannot be achieved. This is true although each node is allowed to have arbitrary degree (note that in this case, the height of a single site search tree is trivially bounded by one). By proposing a method that generates trees of height O( p m), we show the bound to be tight. 1 Introduction Distributed data structures have attracted considerable attention in the past few years.

Indeed, in cases where the users{\textquoteright} intentions are to be kept secret, users are often cautious about accessing the database. It can be shown that when accessing a single database, to completely guarantee the privacy of the user, the whole database should be down-loaded; namely n bits should be communicated (where n is the number of bits in the database).In this work, we investigate whether by replicating the database, more efficient solutions to the private retrieval problem can be obtained. We describe schemes that enable a user to access k replicated copies of a database (k>=2) and privately retrieve information stored in the database. This means that each individual server (holding a replicated copy of the database) gets no information on the identity of the item retrieved by the user. Our schemes use the replication to gain substantial saving. In particular, we present a two-server scheme with communication complexity O(n1/3).

Files are considered similar if they have significant number of common pieces, even if they are very different otherwise. For example, one file may be contained, possibly with some changes, in another file, or a file may be a reorganization of another file. The running time for finding all groups of similar files, even for as little as 25\% similarity, is on the order of 500MB to 1GB an hour. The amount of similarity and several other customized parameters can be determined by the user at a post-processing stage, which is very fast. Sif can also be used to very quickly identify all similar files to a query file using a preprocessed index. Application of sif can be found in file management, information collecting (to remove duplicates), program reuse, file synchronization, data compression, and maybe even plagiarism detection. 1.

While recent research has developed a collection of powerful techniques for minimizing the overhead of writing checkpoint files, checkpointing remains unavailable to most application developers. In this paper we describe libckpt, a portable checkpointing tool for Unix that implements all applicable performance optimizations which are reported in the literature. While libckpt can be used in a mode which is almost totally transparent to the programmer, it also supports the incorporation of user directives into the creation of checkpoints. This user-directed checkpointing is an innovation which is unique to our work. 1 Introduction Consider a programmer who has developed an application which will take a long time to execute, say five days.

Elliptic Curve Public Key Cryptosystems provides an up-to-date and self-contained treatment of elliptic curve-based public key cryptology. Elliptic curve cryptosystems potentially provide equivalent security to the existing public key schemes, but with shorter key lengths. Having short key lengths means smaller bandwidth and memory requirements and can be a crucial factor in some applications, for example the design of smart card systems. The book examines various issues which arise in the secure and efficient implementation of elliptic curve systems.
Elliptic Curve Public Key Cryptosystems is a valuable reference resource for researchers in academia, government and industry who are concerned with issues of data security. Because of the comprehensive treatment, the book is also suitable for use as a text for advanced courses on the subject.},

We discuss several solution criteria for DCOP and clarify the relation between these criteria and dierent levels of agent rationality [Rosenschein and Genesereth 85], and show the algorithms for solving DCOPs in which agents incrementally exchange only necessary information to converge on a mutually satisable bsolution.

The untraceability of the senders is proved to be unconditional, but that of the recipients implicitly
assumes a reliable broadcast network. This assumption is unrealistic in some networks, but it can be removed completely by using the fail-stop key generation schemes by Waidner (these proceedings, =[Waid_89]). In both cases, however, each participant can untraceably and permanently disrupt the entireDC-net.
We present a protocol which guarantees unconditional untraceability, the original goal of the DC-net, onthe inseparability assumption (i.e. the attacker must be unable to prevent honest participants fromcommunicating, which is considerably less than reliable broadcast), and computationally secureserviceability: Computationally restricted disrupters can be identified and removed from the DC-net.
On the one hand, our solution is based on the lovely idea by David Chaum [Chau_88 {\textsection} 2.5] of setting traps for disrupters. He suggests a scheme to guarantee unconditional untraceability and computationally secure serviceability, too, but on the reliable broadcast assumption. The same scheme seems to be used by Bos and den Boer (these proceedings, = [BoBo_89]). We show that this scheme needs some changes and refinements before being secure, even on the reliable broadcast assumption.
On the other hand, our solution is based on the idea of digital signatures whose forgery by an unexpectedly powerful attacker is provable, which might be of independent interest. We propose such a (one-time) signature scheme based on claw-free permutation pairs; the forgery of signatures is equivalent to finding claws, thus in a special case to the factoring problem. In particular, with such signatures we can, for the first time, realize fail-stop Byzantine Agreement, and also adaptive Byzantine Agreement, i.e. Byzantine Agreement which can only be disrupted by an attacker who controls at least a third of all participants and who can forge signatures.
We also sketch applications of these signatures to a payment system, solving disputes about shared secrets, and signatures which cannot be shown round.

We answer this question strongly in the affirmative.

We also show that with such a communication channel, one can have completely noninteractive zero-knowledge proofs of statements in NP. These results do not use any complexity-theoretic assumptions.

We maintain the database as a strongly typed data structure in virtual memory, record updates incrementally on disk in a log and occasionally make a checkpoint of the entire database. We recover from crashes by restoring the database from an old checkpoint then replaying the log. We use existing packages to convert between strongly typed data objects and their disk representations, and to communicate strongly typed data across the network (using remote procedure calls). Our memory is managed entirely by a general purpose allocator and garbage collector. This scheme has been used to implement a name server for a distributed system. The resulting implementation has the desirable property of being simultaneously simple, efficient and reliable. },

In this paper we present several example solutions for managing resources in a decentralized fashion, using multicasting facilities. We review the properties of these solutions in terms of scalability, fault tolerance and efficiency. We conclude that decentralized solutions compare favorably to centralized solutions with respect to all three criteria.},

The Revision Control System (RCS) is a software tool that assists with that task. RCS manages revisions of text documents, in particular source programs, documentation, and test data. It automates the storing, retrieval, logging and identification of revisions, and it provides selection mechanisms for composing configurations. This paper introduces basic version control concepts and discusses the practice of version control using RCS. For conserving space, RCS stores deltas, i.e., differences between successive revisions. Several delta storage methods are discussed. Usage statistics show that RCS{\textquoteright}s delta storage method is space and time efficient. The paper concludes with a detailed survey of version control tools.},

The technique can also be used to form rosters of untraceable digital pseudonyms from selected applications.  Applicants retain the exclusive ability to form digital signatures corresponding to their pseudonyms.  Elections in which any interested party can verify that the ballots have been properly counted are possible if anonymously mailed ballots are signed with pseudonyms from a roster of registered voters.  Another use allows an individual to correspond with a record-keeping organization under a unique pseudonym which appears in a roster of acceptable clients.},

  abstract     = {List structures provide a general mechanism for representing easily changed structured data, but can introduce inefficiencies in the use of space when fields of uniform size are used to contain pointers to data and to link the structure. Empirically determined regularity can be exploited to provide more space-efficient encodings without losing the flexibility inherent in list structures. The basic scheme is to provide compact pointer fields big enough to accommodate most values that occur in them and to provide {\textquotedblleft}escape{\textquotedblright} mechanisms for exceptional cases. Several examples of encoding designs are presented and evaluated, including two designs currently used in Lisp machines. Alternative escape mechanisms are described, and various questions of cost and implementation are discussed. In order to extrapolate our results to larger systems than those measured, we propose a model for the generation of list pointers and we test the model against data from two programs. We show that according to our model, list structures with compact cdr fields will, as address space grows, continue to be compacted well with a fixed-width small field. Our conclusion is that with a microcodable processor, about a factor of two gain in space efficiency for list structure can be had for little or no cost in processing time.},

  abstract  = {This thesis examines the issues relating to non-discretionary access controls for decentralized computing systems. Decentralization changes the basic character of a computing system from a set of processes referencing a data base to a set of processes sending and receiving messages. Because messages must be acknowledged, operations that were read-only in a centralized system become read-write operations. As a result, the lattice model of non-discretionary access control, which mediates operations based on read versus read-write considerations, does not allow direct transfer of algorithms from centralized systems to decentralized systems. This thesis develops new mechanisms that comply with the lattice model and provide the necessary functions for effective decentralized computation. Secure protocols at several different levels are presented in the thesis. At the lowest level, a host or host protocol is shown that allows communication between hosts with effective internal security controls. Above this level, a host independent naming scheme is presented that allows generic naming of services in a manner consistent with the lattice model. The use of decentralized processing to aid in the downgrading of information is shown in the design of a secure intelligent terminal. Schemes are presented to deal with the decentralized administration of the lattice model, and with the proliferation of access classes as the user community of a decentralized system become more diverse. Limitations in the use of end-to-end encryption when used with the lattice model are identified, and a scheme is presented to relax these limitations for broadcast networks. Finally, a scheme is presented for forwarding authentication information between hosts on a network, without transmitting passwords (or their equivalent) over a network.},

Regarding human reciprocal altruism, it is shown that the details of the psychological system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the model. Specifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression, gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects of guilt, and some forms of dishonesty and hypocrisy can be explained as important adaptations to regulate the altruistic system. Each individual human is seen as possessing altruistic and cheating tendencies, the expression of which is sensitive to developmental variables that were selected to set the tendencies at a balance appropriate to the local social and ecological environment.},

  abstract  = {A low-density parity-check code is a code specified by a parity-check matrix with the following properties: each column contains a small fixed numberj geq 3of l{\textquoteright}s and each row contains a small fixed numberk > jof l{\textquoteright}s. The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixedj. When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixedj. A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. Forj > 3and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length. Some experimental results show that the actual probability of decoding error is much smaller than this theoretical bound.},

  abstract     = {The nature of the problems investigated and the techniques employed in this book necessitate a procedure which in many instances is thoroughly mathematical. The mathematical devices used are elementary in the sense that no advanced algebra, or calculus, etc., occurs. (With two, rather unimportant, exceptions: Part of the discussion of an example in 19.7. et sequ. and a remark in A.3.3. make use of some simple integrals.) Concepts originating in set theory, linear geometry and group theory play an important role, but they are invariably taken from the early chapters of those disciplines and are moreover analyzed and explained in special expository sections. Nevertheless the book is not truly elementary because the mathematical deductions are frequently intricate and the logical possibilities are extensively exploited. Thus no specific knowledge of any particular body of advanced mathematics is required. However, the reader who wants to acquaint himself more thoroughly with the subject expounded here, will have to familiarize himself with the mathematical way of reasoning definitely beyond its routine, primitive phases. The character of the procedures will be mostly that of mathematical logics, set theory and functional analysis. We have attempted to present the subject in such a form that a reader who is moderately versed in mathematics can acquire the necessary practice in the course of this study. We hope that we have not entirely failed in this endeavour. In accordance with this, the presentation is not what it would be in a strictly mathematical treatise. All definitions and deductions are considerably broader than they would be there. Besides, purely verbal discussions and analyses take up a considerable amount of space. We have in particular tried to give, whenever possible, a parallel verbal exposition for every major mathematical deduction. It is hoped that this procedure will elucidate in unmathematical language what the mathematical technique signifies-and will also show where it achieves more than can be done without it. ! In this, as well as in our methodological stand, we are trying to follow the best examples of theoretical physics. The reader who is not specifically interested in mathematics should at first omit those sections of the book which in his judgment are too mathematical. We prefer not to give a definite list of them, since this judgment must necessarily be subjective. However, those sections marked with an asterisk in the table of contents are most likely to occur to the average reader inthis connection. At any rate he will find that these omissions will little interfere with the comprehension of the early parts, although the logical chain may in the rigorous sense have suffered an interruption. As he proceeds the omissions will gradually assume a more serious character and the lacunae in the deduction will become more and more significant. The reader is then advised to start again from the beginning since the greater familiarity acquired is likely to facilitate a better understanding.},

provides poor Quality of Experience under typical wide area network conditions and to
propose optimization measures.
After network shaping and the initialization of two isolated GNUnet peers had been
automated, delay measurements were done. With emulated network characteristics net-
work delay, cryptography delays and audio codec delays were measured and transmitted
speech was recorded.
An analysis of the measurement results and a subjective assessment of the speech
recordings revealed that extreme outliers occur in most scenarios and impair QoE. More-
over it was shown that GNUnet conversation introduces a large delay that confines the
environment in which good QoE is possible. In the measurement environment at least 23
ms always ocurred of which large parts are were caused by cryptography. It was shown
that optimization in the cryptography part and other components are possible. Finally
the conditions for currently reaching good QoE were determined and ideas for further
investigations were presented.

It uses an exchange service to issue digital coins using blind signatures, and is thus not subject to the performance issues that plague Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus-based solutions.

The focus of this paper is addressing the challenges payment systems face in the context of the Web.  We discuss how to address Web-specific challenges, such as handling bookmarks and sharing of links, as well as supporting users that have disabled JavaScript.  Web payment systems must also navigate various constraints imposed by modern Web browser security architecture, such as same-origin policies and the separation between browser extensions and Web pages.  While our analysis focuses on how Taler operates within the security infrastructure provided by the modern Web, the results partially generalize to other payment systems.

We also include the perspective of merchants, as existing systems have often struggled with securing payment information at the merchant{\textquoteright}s side.  Here, challenges include avoiding database transactions for customers that do not actually go through with the purchase, as well as cleanly separating security-critical functions of the payment system from the rest of the Web service.},

It requires a group of peers to reach agreement on some value, even if a fraction of the peers is controlled by an adversary. This thesis proposes set union consensus, an efficient generalization of Byzantine consensus from single elements to sets. This is practically motivated by Secure Multiparty Computation protocols such as electronic voting, where a large set of elements must be collected and agreed upon. Existing practical implementations of Byzantine consensus are typically based on state machine replication and not well-suited for agreement on sets, since they must process individual agreements on all set elements in sequence. We describe and evaluate our implementation of set union consensus in GNUnet, which is based on a composition of Eppstein set reconciliation protocol with the simple gradecast consensus prococol described by Ben-Or.},

  abstract  = {Home routers are always-on low power embedded systems and part of the Internet infrastructure. In addition to the basic router functionality, they can be used to operate sensitive personal services, such as for private web and email servers, secure peer-to-peer networking services like GNUnet and Tor, and encrypted network file system services. These services naturally involve cryptographic operations with the cleartext keys being stored in RAM. This makes router devices possible targets to physical attacks by home intruders. Attacks include interception of unprotected data on bus wires, alteration of firmware through exposed JTAG headers, or recovery of cryptographic keys through the cold boot attack.

This thesis presents Panic!, a combination of open hardware design and free software to detect physical integrity attacks and to react by securely erasing cryptographic keys and other sensitive data from memory. To improve auditability and to allow cheap reproduction, the components of Panic! are kept simple in terms of conceptual design and lines of code.

First, the motivation to use home routers for services besides routing and the need to protect their physical integrity is discussed. Second, the idea and functionality of the Panic! system is introduced and the high-level interactions between its components explained. Third, the software components to be run on the router are described. Fourth, the requirements of the measurement circuit are declared and a prototype is presented. Fifth, some characteristics of pressurized environments are discussed and the difficulties for finding adequate containments are explained. Finally, an outlook to tasks left for the future is given.},

  abstract  = {Making communication more resilient is a main focus for modern decentralised networks. A current development to increase connectivity between participants and to be resilient against service degradation attempts is to support different communication protocols, and to switch between these protocols in case degradation or censorship are detected. Supporting multiple protocols with different properties and having to share resources for communication with multiple partners creates new challenges with respect to protocol selection and resource allocation to optimally satisfy the applications{\textquoteright} requirements for communication.

This paper presents a novel approach for automatic transport selection and resource allocation with a focus on decentralised networks. Our goal is to evaluate the communication mechanisms available for each communication partner and then allocate resources in line with the requirements of the applications.

We begin by detailing the overall requirements for an algorithm for transport selection and resource allocation, and then compare three different solutions using (1) a heuristic, (2) linear optimisation, and (3) machine learning. To show the suitability and the specific benefits of each approach, we evaluate their performance with respect to usability, scalability and quality of the solution found in relation to application requirements.},

This paper introduces the design and implementation of the GNU Name System (GNS), a fully decentralized and censorship-resistant name system.  GNS provides a privacy-enhancing alternative to DNS which preserves the desirable property of memorable names. Due to its design, it can also double as a partial replacement of public key infrastructures, such as X.509.  The design of GNS incorporates the capability to integrate and coexist with DNS.  GNS is based on the principle of a petname system and builds on ideas from the Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure (SDSI), addressing a central issue with the decentralized mapping of secure identifiers to memorable names: namely the impossibility of providing a global, secure and memorable mapping without a trusted authority. GNS uses the transitivity in the SDSI design to replace the trusted root with secure delegation of authority, thus making petnames useful to other users while operating under a very strong adversary model.  In addition to describing the GNS design, we also discuss some of the mechanisms that are needed to smoothly integrate GNS with existing processes and procedures in Web browsers.  Specifically, we show how GNS is able to transparently support many assumptions that the existing HTTP(S) infrastructure makes about globally unique names.

  abstract  = {As a means of reducing power consumption, hardware devices are capable to enter into sleep-states that have low power consumption. Waking up from those states in order to return to work is typically a rather energy-intensive activity. Some existing applications have non-urgent tasks that currently force hardware to wake up needlessly or prevent it from going to sleep. It would be better if such non-urgent activities could be scheduled to execute when the respective devices are active
to maximize the duration of sleep-states. This requires cooperation between applications and the kernel in order to determine when the execution of a task will not be expensive in terms of power consumption.

This work presents the design and implementation of Cryogenic, a POSIX-compatible API that enables clustering tasks based on the hardware activity state. Specifically, Cryogenic{\textquoteright}s API allows applications to defer their execution until other tasks use the device they want to use. As a result,
two actions that contribute to reduce the device energy consumption are achieved: reduce the number of hardware wake-ups and maximize the idle periods.

The energy measurements enacted at the end of this thesis demonstrate that, for the specific setup and conditions present during our experimentation, Cryogenic is capable to achieve savings between 1\% and 10\% for a USB WiFi device.

Although we ideally target mobile platforms, Cryogenic has been developed by means a new Linux module that integrates with the existing POSIX event loop system calls. This allows to use Cryogenic on many different platforms as long as they use a GNU/Linux distribution as the main operating system. An evidence of this can be found in this thesis, where we demonstrate the power savings on a single-board computer.

  abstract  = {Elections are a vital tool for decision-making in democratic societies. The past decade has witnessed a handful of attempts to apply modern technology to the election process in order to make it faster and more cost-effective.
Most of the practical efforts in this area have focused on replacing traditional voting booths with electronic terminals, but did not attempt to apply cryptographic techniques able to guarantee critical properties of elections such as secrecy of ballot and verifiability. While such techniques were extensively researched in the past 30 years, practical implementation of cryptographically secure remote electronic voting schemes are not readily available. All existing implementation we are aware of either exhibit critical security flaws, are proprietary black-box systems or require additional physical assumptions such as a preparatory key ceremony executed by the election officials. The latter makes such systems unusable for purely digital communities.
This thesis describes the design and implementation of an electronic voting system in GNUnet, a framework for secure and decentralized networking. We provide a short survey of voting schemes and existing implementations. The voting scheme we implemented makes use of threshold cryptography, a technique which requires agreement among a large subset of the election officials to execute certain
cryptographic operations. Since such protocols have applications outside of electronic voting, we describe their design and implementation in GNUnet separately.

But realizing such an infrastructure is hard to achieve due to the decentralized nature of the network especially if the anomaly occurs on systems not operated by developers or participants get separated from the collection points. In this thesis a decentralized monitoring infrastructure using a decentralized peer-to-peer network is developed to collect information and detect anomalies in a collaborative way without coordination by and in absence of a centralized infrastructure and report detected incidents to a monitoring infrastructure.

We start by introducing background information about peer-to-peer networks, anomalies and anomaly detection techniques in literature. Then we present some of the related work regarding monitoring decentralized networks, anomaly detection and data aggregation in decentralized networks. Then we perform an analysis of the system objectives, target environment and the desired properties of the system. Then we design the system in terms of the overall structure and its individual components. We follow with details about the system implementation. Lastly, we evaluate the final system implementation against our desired objectives.},

  abstract  = {The successful operation of a peer-to-peer network depends on the resilience of its peer{\textquoteright}s
communications. On the Internet, direct connections between peers are often limited by restrictions like NATs and traffic filtering. Addressing such problems is particularly pressing for peer-to-peer networks that do not wish to rely on any trusted infrastructure, which might otherwise help the participants establish communication channels. Modern peer-to-peer networks employ various techniques to address the problem of restricted connectivity on the Internet. One interesting development is that various overlay networks now support multiple communication protocols to improve resilience and counteract service degradation.

The support of multiple protocols causes a number of new challenges. A peer should evaluate which protocols fulfill the communication requirements best. Furthermore, limited resources, such as bandwidth, should be distributed among peers and protocols to match application requirements. Existing approaches to this problem of transport selection and resource allocation are rigid: they calculate the solution only from the current state of the
environment, and do not adapt their strategy based on failures or successes of previous
allocations.

This thesis explores the feasibility of using machine learning to improve the quality of the transport selection and resource allocation over current approaches. The goal is to improve the solution process by learning selection and allocation strategies from the experience gathered in the course of many iterations of the algorithm. We compare the different approaches in the field of machine learning with respect to their properties and suitability for the problem. Based on this evaluation and an in-depth analysis of the requirements of the underlying problem, the thesis presents a design how reinforcement learning can be used and adapted to the given problem domain.

The design is evaluated with the help of simulation and a realistic implementation in the GNUnet Peer-to-Peer framework. Our experimental results highlight some of the implications of the multitude of implementation choices, key challenges, and possible directions for the use of reinforcement learning in this domain.},

  abstract  = {Linear programming (LP) has numerous applications in different fields. In some scenarios, e.g. supply chain master planning (SCMP), the goal is solving linear programs involving multiple parties reluctant to sharing their private information. In this case, methods from the area of secure multi-party computation (SMC) can be used. Secure multi-party versions of LP solvers have been known to be impractical due to high communication complexity. To overcome this, solutions based on problem transformation have been put forward.

In this thesis, one such algorithm, proposed by Dreier and Kerschbaum, is discussed, implemented, and evaluated with respect to numerical stability and scalability. Results
obtained with different parameter sets and different test cases are presented and some problems are exposed. It was found that the algorithm has some unforeseen limitations, particularly when implemented within the bounds of normal primitive data types. Random numbers generated during the protocol have to be extremely small so as to not cause problems with overflows after a series of multiplications. The number of peers participating additionally limits the size of numbers. A positive finding was that results produced when none of the aforementioned problems occur are generally quite accurate. We discuss a few possibilities to overcome some of the problems with an implementation using arbitrary precision numbers.

End-to-end encrypted communication is provided by the mesh service of GNUnet, upon which the multicast channels are built.  Pseudonymous users and social places in the system have cryptographical identities --- identified by their public key --- these are mapped to human memorable names using GNS (GNU Name System), where each pseudonym has a zone pointing to its places.

  abstract     = {A central problem on the Internet today is that key infrastructure for security is concentrated in a few places.  This is particularly true in the areas of naming and public key infrastructure. Secret services and other government organizations can use this fact to block access to information or monitor communications.  One of the most popular and easy to perform techniques is to make information on the Web inaccessible by censoring or manipulating the Domain Name System (DNS).  With the introduction of DNSSEC, the DNS is furthermore posed to become an alternative PKI to the failing X.509 CA system, further cementing the power of those in charge of operating DNS.

This paper maps the design space and gives design requirements for censorship resistant name systems.  We survey the existing range of ideas for the realization of such a system and discuss the challenges these systems have to overcome in practice.  Finally, we present the results from a survey on browser usage, which supports the idea that delegation should be a key ingredient in any censorship resistant name system.

While the current state-of-the-art simulation allows evaluations with many millions of peers through the use of abstractions, emulation still lags behind as it involves executing the real implementation at some parts of the system.  This difference in scales can make it hard to relate the evaluations made created with simulation and emulation during the design and implementation phases and can results in a limited evaluation of the implementation, which may cause severe problems after deployment.

In this thesis, we build upon an existing emulator for P2P applications to push the scales offered by emulation towards the limits set by simulation.  Our approach distributes and co-ordinates the emulation across many hosts.  Large deployments are possible by deploying hundreds or thousands of peers on each host.

To address the varying needs of an experimenter and the range of available hardware, we make our approach scalable such that it can easily be adapted to run evaluations on a single machine or a large group of hosts.  Specifically, the system automatically adjusts the number of overlapping operations to the available resources efficiently using a feedback mechanism, thus relieving the experimenter from the hassles of manual tuning.

We specifically target HPC systems like compute clusters and supercomputers and demonstrate how such systems can be used for large scale emulations by evaluating two P2P applications with deployment sizes up to 90k peers on a supercomputer.},

The system builds on ideas from Rivest{\textquoteright}s Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure (SDSI) to address a central issue with providing a decentralized mapping of secure identifiers to memorable names: providing a global, secure and memorable mapping is impossible without a trusted authority.  SDSI offers an alternative by linking local name spaces; GADS uses the transitivity provided by the SDSI design to build a decentralized and censorship resistant name system without a trusted root based on secure  delegation of authority.

Additional details need to be considered in order to enable GADS to integrate smoothly with the World Wide Web.  While following links on the Web matches following delegations in GADS, the existing HTTP-based infrastructure makes many assumptions about globally unique names; however, proxies can be used to enable legacy applications to function with GADS.

This work presents the fundamental goals and ideas behind GADS, provides technical details on how GADS has been implemented and discusses deployment issues for using GADS with existing systems.  We discuss how GADS and legacy DNS can interoperate during a transition period and what additional security advantages GADS offers over DNS with Security Extensions (DNSSEC).

  abstract  = {  The contribution of this thesis is the study and improvement of secure, decentralized, robust routing algorithms for open networks including ad-hoc networks and peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks. The main goals for our secure routing algorithm are openness, efficiency, scalability and resilience to various types of attacks. Common P2P routing algorithms trade-off decentralization for security; for instance by choosing whether or not to require a centralized authority to allow peers to join the network. Other algorithms trade scalability for security, for  example employing random search or flooding to prevent certain types of attacks.  Our design attempts to meet our security goals in an open system, while limiting the performance penalties incurred.

  The first step we took towards designing our routing algorithm was an analysis of the routing algorithm in Freenet.  This algorithm is relevant because it achieves efficient (order O(log n)) routing in realistic network topologies in a fully decentralized open network.  However, we demonstrate why their algorithm is not secure, as malicious participants are able to severely disrupt the operation of the network.  The main difficulty with the Freenet routing algorithm is that for performance it relies on information received from untrusted peers.  We also detail a range of proposed solutions, none of which we found to fully fix the problem.

 A related problem for efficient routing in sparsely connected networks is the difficulty in sufficiently populating routing tables.  One way to improve connectivity in P2P overlay networks is by utilizing modern NAT traversal techniques.  We employ a number of standard NAT traversal techniques in our approach, and also developed
and experimented with a novel method for NAT traversal based on ICMP and UDP hole punching.  Unlike other NAT traversal techniques ours does not require a trusted third party.

Another technique we use in our implementation to help address the connectivity problem in sparse networks is the use of distance vector routing in a small local neighborhood. The distance vector variant used in our system employs onion routing to secure the resulting indirect connections. Materially to this design, we discovered a  serious vulnerability in the Tor protocol which allowed us to use a DoS attack to reduce the anonymity of the users of this extant anonymizing P2P network.  This vulnerability is based on allowing paths of unrestricted length for onion routes through the network. Analyzing Tor and implementing this attack gave us valuable knowledge
which helped when designing the distance vector routing protocol for our system.

  Finally, we present the design of our new secure randomized routing algorithm that does not suffer from the various problems we discovered in previous designs. Goals for the algorithm include providing efficiency and robustness in the presence of malicious participants for an open, fully decentralized network without trusted authorities. We provide a mathematical analysis of the algorithm itself and have created and deployed an implementation of this algorithm in GNUnet. In this thesis we also provide a detailed overview of a distributed
emulation framework capable of running a large number of nodes using our full code base as well as some of the challenges encountered in creating and using such a testing framework.  We present extensive experimental results showing that our routing algorithm outperforms the dominant DHT design in target topologies, and performs comparably in other scenarios.

We have implemented our routing algorithm and have evaluated its performance under various topologies and in the presence of malicious peers.  For small-world topologies, our algorithm provides significantly better performance when compared to existing methods. In more densely connected topologies, our performance is better than or on par with other designs.

  abstract  = {In spite of the central role of key derivation functions (KDF) in applied cryptography, there has been little formal work addressing the design and analysis of general multi-purpose KDFs. In practice, most KDFs (including those widely standardized) follow ad-hoc approaches that treat cryptographic hash functions as perfectly random functions. In this paper we close some gaps between theory and practice by contributing to the study and engineering of KDFs in several ways. We provide detailed rationale for the design of KDFs based on the extract-then-expand approach; we present the first general and rigorous definition of KDFs and their security which we base on the notion of computational extractors; we specify a concrete fully practical KDF based on the HMAC construction; and we provide an analysis of this construction based on the extraction and pseudorandom properties of HMAC. The resultant KDF design can support a large variety of KDF applications under suitable assumptions on the underlying hash function; particular attention and effort is devoted to minimizing these assumptions as much as possible for each usage scenario.

Beyond the theoretical interest in modeling KDFs, this work is intended to address two important and timely needs of cryptographic applications: (i) providing a single hash-based KDF design that can be standardized for use in multiple and diverse applications, and (ii) providing a conservative, yet efficient, design that exercises much care in the way it utilizes a cryptographic hash function.

(The HMAC-based scheme presented here, named HKDF, is being standardized by the IETF.)},
