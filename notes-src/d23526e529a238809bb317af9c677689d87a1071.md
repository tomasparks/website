    name: The Dark Episode
    author: Jason Scott
    content: "Jason Scott Talks His Way Out Of It:\_A weekly podcast series about
      stories, technology, nostalgia, wonder, and more stores. Hosted by Jason Scott
      of TEXTFILES.COM.  The Dark Episode: Applejack, Rage, A Full Mailbox, Getting
      Better, The Best Life, Debt Unchained. \_   Like, I bet, most everyone out there,
      not every part of my life has been 100% great. I decided to just pack all that
      negativity (especially teenage years) into one episode so we can move on to
      more fun stories. This was definitely a hard episode to record and a harder
      one to shape into a cohesive whole. I'm glad I did it, but I look forward to
      more about beeps, boops and laughter.  This podcast is supported by a Patreon
      at\_http://patreon.com/textfiles. Jason can be followed at\_https://twitter.com/textfiles\_and
      you are perennially invited to visit his website, TEXTFILES.COM."
