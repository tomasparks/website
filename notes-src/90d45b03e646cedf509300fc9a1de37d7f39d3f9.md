    name: What The Hell Is Initiative Q?
    author: Techdirt
    content: By now, there's a good chance you've received an invitation to join Initiative
      Q, and also a good chance that you took one look at it and thought "wow, this
      seems extremely sketchy." And indeed, there's little reason (other than hopefulness)
      to see the strange new proposed payment system as anything but a pyramid scheme.
      But it's got people talking, thanks in no small part to its viral marketing
      scheme, so this week's episode is all about trying to figure out just what Initiative
      Q really is.
