    name: The Tough Choices Platforms Make
    author: Techdirt
    content: Back in March, Mike moderated a panel at RightsCon on the subject of
      intermediary liability and the delicate balancing act that platform providers
      have to play on that front, with lawyers from Meetup, Change.org, and Medium.
      This week, in lieu of a regular podcast episode we've got a recording of that
      discussion, which delves deeply into some of the difficult choices companies
      like this have to make.
