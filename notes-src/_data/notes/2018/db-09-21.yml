      content: "Digg was the earliest high flying startup in early social media. But
        then, other startups started to steal the limelight. Digg tried to keep up
        by launching Digg version 4. And\u2026 users hate it. Many people feel that
        the reason Reddit is Reddit today is because the Digg community fled their
        en-masse. Digg Version 4 has become legendary as a redesign so disruptive
        it can kill a company. So, what\u2019s the real story? Today, we talk to Will
        Larson, who was a young engineer working on the launch of Digg version "

      content: "Today, we're going to continue our occasional project of getting oral
        histories and personal anecdotes about how, exactly, the Internet and the
        web came to various places around the world. On this episode we're going to
        look at how the Internet came to\u2014and is still in the process of coming
        to\u2014Pakistan. Imran Haider is a listener to the show, works in the tech
        industry, and analyzes the south asian tech scene at his blog, arkito.co.
        Today, he tells us how the digital revolution came to Pakistan, how it's still
        in the process of rolling out, what that has meant for Pakistani society and
        what the startup and tech scene IS in Pakistan. My thanks to Imran Haider
        for being a longtime listener to this show, and for being willing to contribute
        to the project, and please, check him out at arkito.co... it's Ben Thompson
        level analysis of the tech scene in the sub continent.\r\n      "

      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: Nando.net was not only a very early experiment in bringing journalism
        to the web, it was also one of those local ISP's that flowered in the era
        of the early 1990s. Fraser Von Asch was not only one of the key players at
        The News & Observer (thus, "NandO") who brought the project to life, he is
        another person who has straddled the media industry between the print and
        digital eras and can give us some amazing insights into the transitions therein...
        or lack thereof.
