      name: 152. David Shen on Early Yahoo and the Maturation of Online Advertising
      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: "David Shen was employee #17 at Yahoo, where he eventually had a hand
        in, not only the birth of advertising as the primary business model for the
        web but, eventually, the development of digital ads into their more modern,
        interactive form. As you\u2019ll hear, David recounts the early days of Yahoo,
        surviving the dotcom bust and taking advertising beyond the simple banner
        ad.\r\n\r\nAnd he recounts all of this in his recently published new book:
        Takeover! The Inside Story of the Yahoo! Ad Revolution"

        lost his interest in coming up with new tools and new technologies. Dave was
        kind enough to sit down and go over his whole career, from the very earliest
