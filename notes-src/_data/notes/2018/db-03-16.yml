      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: "Just as last week\u2019s episode posted, another great piece about
        SoundCloud was posted on Buzzfeed by the great Ryan Mac. So, in a rare attempt
        by me to be topical, today\u2019s episode is with Ryan Mac, discussing his
        article, which fills in some of the details about what Christina and I were
        speculating on last week."

      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: "Karel Baloun was the first senior software engineer hired at Facebook
        in 2005. Baloun was only at Facebook for a year, from 2005 to 2006, but he
        provides some amazing insights about the company. What was Facebook\u2019s
        culture like in 2005? What were the key innovations that ultimately let Facebook
        succeed where others failed? Would Zuckerberg make a good President of the
        United States? What became of Pokey, the mascot Facebook once considered launching?"
