      author: Techdirt
      content: "Lots of people have tried to sum up the differences between Silicon
        Valley and Washington, D.C. \u2014 but it isn't so easy to hone in on. Nevertheless,
        it's clear that at least some aspects of the west-coast tech approach could
        benefit a government that all-too-often appears incapable of accomplishing
        anything much. This week, we're joined by former US Deputy Chief Technology
        Officer and Code For America founder Jennifer Pahlka to discuss what the Hill
        can learn from the Valley."

      name: Crying Wolf Over Conservative Censorship
      author: Techdirt
      content: "You've heard the uproar \u2014 conservatives are being censored on
        social media! But... are they? The short answer is no. The long answer is
        this week's podcast, with Lincoln Network policy head Zach Graves joining
        us for a discussion about the misinformation, hyperbole and general ridiculousness
        surrounding supposed social media bias."
