      content: "We've done it \u2014 we've solved the challenge of content moderation!
        (Checks notes). No, wait, sorry: we haven't. But what we have done is invited
        Kate Klonick, law professor and author of the excellent paper The New Governors:
        The People, Rules, and Processes Governing Online Speech, to join us for an
        in-depth discussion about how we got here and why there are no easy or simple
        answers for content moderation."

      content: A major insurance company recently announced that it would offer discounts
        on life insurance to customers who wear activity trackers and log data showing
        they live a healthy lifestyle. This understandably freaked out some people,
        but there are interesting aspects to the idea as well. There's plenty to consider,
        so this week regular hosts Mike, Hersh and Dennis discuss whether this is
        an exciting innovation, a worrying expansion of surveillance culture, or both.
