    name: Can Direct Democracy Work?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Technology has made \"direct democracy\" \u2014 letting citizens vote
      on specific, granular issues instead of just electing representatives \u2014
      more viable than ever, but does that mean it's a good idea? This week, we discuss
      the ins and outs of direct democracy, including a special addendum on the surprising
      results of the Brexit referendum."
