    content: In this last episode before Chris Aldrich and I head to the Indieweb
      Summit in Portland, Oregon, he and I discuss my continual messing up of people&#8217;s
      Indieweb experience, little things I&#8217;ve hidden in plugins, web-signin
      vs IndieAuth, etc. We&#8217;re both looking forward to seeing those of you who
      can join us in Portland.
