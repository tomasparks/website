    name: The Game World Episode
    author: Jason Scott
    content: "The Game Worlds Episode: Getting Ready to Explore, The Games I Love,
      Adventure, Ten Years of Destiny, Halo Forever, Car Without an Engine, Player
      Unknown: Introspections, The Dangerous Mechanism, No Man's Sky, Exploring Forever.
      Plus: The Sound of Taxes.\r\n\r\nWhy have such a simple podcast if you can't
      try new things? I thought I'd go into a very ethereal and strange way of looking
      at technology and games. I'm not sure if I caught the feeling I wanted to give,
      but I gave it my best shot. "
