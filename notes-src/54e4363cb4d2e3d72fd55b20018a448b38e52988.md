    name: Donald Trump, Howard Stern--- And Copyright
    author: Techdirt
    content: This episode was supposed to come two weeks ago when the news was a little
      fresher, so by now you almost certainly know all about the copyright claims
      on Donald Trump's appearances on the Howard Stern show. Though delayed by an
      outage at our cloud recording provider, the episode is still an interesting
      listen, with frequent Techdirt contributor Cathy Gellis joining the podcast
      to discuss the deeper question of whether copyright truly even exists on the
      interviews in the first place. Sorry for the delay, and we hope you enjoy it!
