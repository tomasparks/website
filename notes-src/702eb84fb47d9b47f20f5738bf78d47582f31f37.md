    name: 'The Worst Of Both Worlds: SESTA & FOSTA Together'
    author: Techdirt
    content: "It wasn't very long ago that we last discussed SESTA on the podcast,
      but now that the House has voted to approve its version of the bill with SESTA
      tacked on, it's unfortunately time to dig into the issues again. So this week
      we're joined by returning guest Emma Llans\xF3 from the Center for Democracy
      and Technology and, for the first time, law professor Eric Goldman to talk about
      why the combination of SESTA and FOSTA has resulted in the worst of both worlds."
