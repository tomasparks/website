    name: Is Facebook Moderation A Necessary Evil?
    author: Techdirt
    content: Facebook's efforts to moderate content that appears on the social network
      have run into numerous problems, most recently with a famous war photo and a
      bunch of blog posts. Some have made absurd demands in response, such as giving
      old-school media editors special posting privileges, while others have objected
      to the idea of Facebook censoring any content whatsoever. But is that objection
      realistic? This week, we discuss the complicated question of Facebook moderation,
      and what the company's role can and should be.
