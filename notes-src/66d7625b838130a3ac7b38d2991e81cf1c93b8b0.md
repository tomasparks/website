    name: MEP Julia Reda Explains What's Next With The EU Copyright Directive
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Unfortunately, as you know by now, the EU Parliament approved the current
      (disastrous) version of the EU Copyright Directive, which is now on track to
      become the law of the land. It's not good, but things aren't quite over yet.
      For this week's episode, we've got returning guest MEP Julia Reda \u2014 who
      has been a key force opposing the terrible articles in the Directive \u2014
      to talk about what happens now."
