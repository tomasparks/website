    name: Pardon Snowden
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Edward Snowden deserves a pardon. We all know it \u2014 even if you
      believe he deserves to stand trial, the only option right now is an unfair trial
      on Espionage Act charges in which he'd be blocked from presenting a meaningful
      defense. A pardon from those charges is the only just choice. This week, we're
      joined by Trevor Timm, co-founder of the Freedom Of The Press Foundation, and
      returning guest Parker Higgins to discuss why Edward Snowden deserves a pardon,
      and the campaign to get him one deserves your support."
