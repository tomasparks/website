    name: Wi-fi is watching us
    author: ABC Radio National
    content: Many of us access the internet, and the world wide web, via wi-fi. Wi-fi
      lets us into a fabulous world of shared knowledge and social interaction. On
      the flip side, it seems that wi-fi can look at us, and perhaps even spy on us.
      It can even recognize moving humans on the other side of a wall. And this happens
      by examining not the content of the wi-fi signal, but its strength and timing.
