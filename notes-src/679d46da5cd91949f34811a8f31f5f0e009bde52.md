    name: The Crypto Wars May Never End
    author: Techdirt
    content: "The current instalment of the crypto wars hit full stride with the clash
      between Apple and the FBI, but in truth the tension over encryption has been
      around for a long time \u2014 and it doesn't look like it's going away anytime
      soon. As our readers know, Tim Cushing has been following these developments
      closely, and this week he joins the podcast for a discussion about encryption,
      law enforcement and \"going dark\"."
