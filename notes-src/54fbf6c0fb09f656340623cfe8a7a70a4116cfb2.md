    name: The Link Between Credit And Surveillance
    author: Techdirt
    content: Both surveillance and the digitization of money are heavily-discussed
      topics, but the intersection between the two often goes overlooked. Historically,
      credit agencies have been trailblazers in the world of surveillance, and today
      we face the fact that the government can use payment providers and other financial
      tools as a means of enforcing its wishes. On this week's episode, we're joined
      by lawyer and writer Sarah Jeong, who recently wrote a four-part series on the
      subject, to discuss the past and future of credit, money, surveillance and the
      way they work together.
