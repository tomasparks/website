    content: Today we continue my efforts to preserve the history of the ISP industry.
      Today it feels like the Internet is simply all around us all the time, but there
      are amazing entrepreneurial stories about how that crucial infrastructure was
      laid. Today we talk to Sonic founder Dane Jasper, who can not only give us the
      history of the industry, but the present day as well, as Sonic is still a thriving
      and important independent ISP.
