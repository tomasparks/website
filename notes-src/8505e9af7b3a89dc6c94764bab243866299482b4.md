    name: 'Introducing IRL: Because Online Life is Real Life'
    author: Mozilla
    content: "Our online life is real life. We walk, talk, work, LOL and even love
      on the Internet \u2013 but we don\u2019t always treat it like real life. Host
      Veronica Belmont explores this disconnect with stories from the wilds of the
      Web \u2013 and gets to the bottom of online issues that affect us all. Whether
      it\u2019s privacy breaches, closed platforms, hacking, fake news, or cyber bullying,
      we the people have the power to change the course of the Internet, keeping it
      healthy, weird, and wonderful for everyone.\n"
