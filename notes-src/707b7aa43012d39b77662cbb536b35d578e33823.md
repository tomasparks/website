    name: Patent Trolls, With Cloudflare's General Counsel
    author: Techdirt
    content: As we reported last month, CDN provider Cloudflare has decided to hit
      back against patent troll Blackbird Technologies with an aggressive strategy.
      Leading this charge is Doug Kramer, Cloudflare's General Counsel, who joins
      us this week to discuss the current situation with Blackbird and the broader
      patent landscape.
