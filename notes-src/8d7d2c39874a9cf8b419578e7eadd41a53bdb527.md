    name: Free Culture And Aaron Swartz (Part One)
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Anyone even remotely interested in free culture, the internet and copyright
      surely knows the name Aaron Swartz \u2014 but only some truly understand what
      made him tick, and why he was considered so special and important in that world.
      This week and next, we're joined by Justin Peters, author of The Idealist, a
      new book that takes a close look at Aaron himself as well as the internet culture
      that gave rise to his attitudes and activism, which is the focus of this first
      half of the discussion."
