    content: "Its been over a week since the last episode. I\u2019ve been really busy
      with work and family and\u2026 you know\u2026 life! Its been a bit stressful,
      honestly, and that\u2019s what this episode is all about. Its a big shift from
      the first few episodes, but this time, I talk a bit about my brain, and my efforts
      to get more mentally and physically healthy.\n\n\n\n"
