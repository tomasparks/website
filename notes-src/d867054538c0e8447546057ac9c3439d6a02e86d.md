    content: "Acquired is live on the scene following Dropbox\u2019s public market
      debut. From playing a central role in the early days of Y Combinator, to having
      Steve Jobs famously label the company a \u201Cfeature not a product\u201D, to
      pivoting from consumers to enterprise to developers and back again, the silicon
      valley history runs deep with this one. What twists and turns lie ahead for
      Dropbox as a public company? We speculate!"
