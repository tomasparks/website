    name: Cloak of Invisibility
    author: Mozilla
    content: "On the Internet no one knows you\u2019re a dog, as the old joke goes.
      But does anonymity truly exist on the web anymore? And when it\u2019s taken
      from us, what else do we lose? So Sad Today talks about the value of anonymity
      for women and self-care. Jonathan Hirshon shares his personal battle to keep
      his face off the Internet. New Yorker cartoonists Peter Steiner and Kaamran
      Hafeez discuss the evolution of memes and digital anonymity, in dog years.  And
      Alison Macrina and Morgan Taylor reveal what\u2019s underneath the surface of
      the searchable web.\n"
