    name: Is The Internet Of Things The Future, A Total Mess, Or Both?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "The internet of things has been taking plenty of flack ever since the
      first time someone floated the idea of a connected fridge or some-such in the
      90s \u2014 but despite the knee-jerk instinct to scoff at some things, the truth
      is there are all sorts of interesting possibilities emerging from all these
      \"pointless\" connected devices. Of course, there are also some serious security
      concerns--- This week, we discuss IoT and what the ever-increasing presence
      of such devices means for the future."
