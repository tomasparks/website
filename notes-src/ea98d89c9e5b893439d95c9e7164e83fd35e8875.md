    name: 'Ep. 4: Keep Creepers (The Moonstone Saga)'
    author: HeadGum
    content: 'The almost-heroes come face-to-face with the Bullywug king himself,
      then find themselves trailing an even greater enemy! Hardwon bravely runs away
      ("because it''s smart and not because it''s cowardly"), Moonshine gets her stealth
      on ("like Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment"), and Beverly attempts to channel
      Steve Irwin. '
