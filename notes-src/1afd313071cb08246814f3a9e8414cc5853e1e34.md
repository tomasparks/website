      Five, Gunderloy, Anarchy, Factsheet Five''s Big Party, Internet, Zines, PDFs.

      best printed things on earth at the time. The Internet Archive Zine collection
      is massive and growing: https://archive.org/details/zines Factsheet Five has
      a few issues up on the archive, but we need a large and high-quality scanning
      of this thing. https://archive.org/search.php?query=factsheet%20five We even
      have a pretty zesty Loompanics catalog: https://archive.org/details/Loompanics_Catalog_2003'
