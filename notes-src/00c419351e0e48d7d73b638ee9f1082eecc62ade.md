    name: Lies, Damned Lies & Audience Metrics
    author: Techdirt
    content: "In 2016, mostly out of frustration, I wrote a post about how traffic
      is fake, audience numbers are garbage, and nobody knows how many people see
      anything. My feelings haven't changed much, and neither has the digital advertising
      ecosystem. And since regular podcast co-host Dennis Yang runs a digital metrics
      company, it only made sense for us to hash it out on an episode all about audience
      measurement and how it shapes online advertising.\r\n\r\n2016 Post: https://tdrt.io/fOt"
