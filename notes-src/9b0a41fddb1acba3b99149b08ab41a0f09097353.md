    content: 'The Firing Episode: That Time I Got Fired, A Sysadmin''s Life, If You
      Lose Jason You Lose Us, A Steaming Cup of Coffee, The Unnamed Worst Customer
      Ever, Goodbye, Hello Internet Archive. An episode about the only time I''ve
      been fired so far! Not bad for roughly 20 years of working life. I am pretty
      sure I got most of the details right, but you never know. I say this compared
      to most of the talking about history I do because it seems to be that when a
      person describes an emotionally traumatic event, they tend to get details real
      weird - it must be how the brain copes. Subscribe and support this podcast at
