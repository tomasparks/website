    name: The End Of Ownership
    author: Techdirt
    content: 'The basic impetus behind DRM is obvious: a frantic, misguided desire
      to make digital products behave like physical ones. But the truth is DRM goes
      far, far beyond that, restricting all sorts of activities that are intrinsic
      to the idea of "owning" something. Two people who have thought a lot about this
      are law professors Aaron Perzanowski and Jason Schultz, authors of the new book
      The End Of Ownership. This week, Aaron and Jason join the podcast to discuss
      the book and the worrying status of DRM today.'
