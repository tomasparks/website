    name: 152. David Shen on Early Yahoo and the Maturation of Online Advertising
    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: "David Shen was employee #17 at Yahoo, where he eventually had a hand
      in, not only the birth of advertising as the primary business model for the
      web but, eventually, the development of digital ads into their more modern,
      interactive form. As you\u2019ll hear, David recounts the early days of Yahoo,
      surviving the dotcom bust and taking advertising beyond the simple banner ad.\r\n\r\nAnd
      he recounts all of this in his recently published new book: Takeover! The Inside
      Story of the Yahoo! Ad Revolution"
