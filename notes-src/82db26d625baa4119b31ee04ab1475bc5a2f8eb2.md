    name: 139. The Napster Story with Jordan Ritter
    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: 'Napster was an incredible phenomenon, reaching tens of millions of users
      at its height, and though Jordan Ritter didn''t invent Napster, he very much
      was responsible for scaling it and turning it into the phenomenon it became.
      In today''s episode, Jordan recounts the entire Napster story, from its gestation
      in the w00w00 hacker collective (which, by the way, people talk a lot about
      the PayPal mafia, but an argument can be made for a w00w00 mafia) all the way
      through Napster''s legal descent into oblivion. '
