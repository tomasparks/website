    author: Techdirt
    content: "Eliot Peper is a novelist who uses thorough research and creative thinking
      to produce science fiction that can feel more like eerily-accurate prognostication.
      Exploring possible futures with real insight has always been one of sci-fi's
      greatest strengths, and this week Peper joins Mike on the podcast to discuss
      his work, methods, and ideas about tomorrow.\r\n\r\nEliot Peper - http://www.eliotpeper.com/"
