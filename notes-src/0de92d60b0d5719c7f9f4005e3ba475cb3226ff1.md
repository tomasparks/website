    content: "Godfather of Podcasting. One of the key people involved in the development
      of CSS. But as you\u2019ll hear in this great and wide ranging chat, Dave Winer
      is just a software developer who has never stopped tinkering, never lost his
      interest in coming up with new tools and new technologies. Dave was kind enough
      to sit down and go over his whole career, from the very earliest days of the
      PC era, to the present day.\r\n"
