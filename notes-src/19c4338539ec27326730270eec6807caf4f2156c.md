    name: 165. Claire L. Evans, Author of Broad Band- The Untold Story of the Women
      Who Made the Internet
    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: "Claire Evans is the author of the new book: Broad Band The Untold Story
      of the Women Who Made the Internet. This is the best tech history book I\u2019ve
      read in a while and you know I read them all. Of special note, considering our
      90s-heavy focus on this podcast, the book includes the stories of Word.com,
      which was a competitor to Feed.com (which we\u2019ve previously covered) and
      Women.com which was a competitor to Ivillage (which, again, we\u2019ve spoke
      at length about). "
