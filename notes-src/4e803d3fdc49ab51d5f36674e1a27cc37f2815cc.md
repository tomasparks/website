    content: 'The Internet Archive Grab Bag: Another Week Online, The Archive Building,
      The Verifications, The Ups and Downs, The Narrative, Patreon Fail, PODCAST.TEXTFILES.COM,
      Building Pride and Love, Teeth, Thanks.  Recorded on the office floor of the
      Internet Archive, I went for a grab bag of random thoughts, so this episode
      is very, very loose. I also didn''t have my pop shield out here, so apologies
      to your speakers. I mention the Patreon stupid and also offer PODCAST.TEXTFILES.COM
      as the secure central information and donation vector for this podcast going
      forward. It has been quite the ride watching support drop and return for this
      Patreon, and I don''t need more uncertainty in my life, thanks.  Opinion seems
      to float that people would like an interview show or similar, but I''d probably
      make it a bonus, because it would be different than this format, and notably
      longer. We''ll see when that happens, but it''s on my mind. Next episodes will
      be much less miscellaneous, but it felt great to talk about it all. Thanks for
      riding along.'
