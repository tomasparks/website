    name: The Human Costs of Content Moderation
    author: Mozilla
    content: "What, if anything, should be banned from online media? And who should
      review violent and explicit content, in order to decide if it\u2019s okay for
      the public? Thousands of people around the world are working long, difficult
      hours as content moderators in support of sites like Facebook, Twitter, and
      YouTube. They are guided by complex and shifting guidelines, and their work
      can sometimes lead to psychological trauma. But the practice of content moderation
      also raises questions about censorship and free expression online.\n"
