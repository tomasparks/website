    name: How One Court Just Screwed Up Software Development
    author: Techdirt
    content: "We've already written about the insanity of the appeals court overturning
      Google's fair use victory against Oracle \u2014 but there's plenty to dig into
      regarding just how bad the ruling is. This week, we're joined by Pamela Samuelson,
      a law professor and co-director of the Center for Law & Technology at Berkeley,
      to discuss what the court just did to the world of software development."
