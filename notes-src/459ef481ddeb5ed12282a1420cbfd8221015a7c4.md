    name: Is Capitalism Over?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "As technology ushers more and more things towards the realm of \"post-scarcity\",
      an inevitable conversation has arisen around the very roots of capitalism and
      what this rapid change means for our economic systems at the most fundamental
      levels. But the answer is far from simple \u2014 is capitalism dying? Can it
      evolve? Is the whole question being framed incorrectly? This week, we discuss
      the notion of a post-capitalist world, what it might look like, and how close
      it actually is."
