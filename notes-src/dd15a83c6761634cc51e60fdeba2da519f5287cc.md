    author: Techdirt
    content: "I don't think I need to say much to introduce this week's topic \u2014
      we're all well aware of the conversation about Facebook's role in the presidential
      election, including questions of filter bubbles, fake news, foreign influence,
      and so on and so on. As is always the case in situations like this, a lot of
      people seem to be looking for easy answers, and easy places to point fingers
      of blame, so in this week's episode we're discussing why it's just not that
      simple."
