    name: '''Disruption'' Is Not An Excuse For Lying'
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Silicon Valley has produced lots of disruptive technologies \u2014 ways
      to solve problems by upending entrenched industries and, often enough, routing
      around protectionist regulations. But not all regulations are meaningless, not
      all industries are easy to disrupt, and sometimes \"fake it until you make it\"
      becomes plain old lying. This week, we discuss what happens when \"disruption\"
      goes wrong."
