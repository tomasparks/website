    name: Passwords Suck; What's Next?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Data breaches that expose passwords are pretty much a fact of life at
      this point \u2014 and the effects are multiplied by the fact that many, many
      people reuse passwords no matter how much they know they shouldn't. As such,
      there's a big push to move to password managers, two-factor authentication,
      and even biometrics \u2014 because the simple fact is the password sucks. This
      week, we're discussing what if anything will succeed in replacing it."
