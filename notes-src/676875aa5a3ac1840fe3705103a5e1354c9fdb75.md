    content: Ok, part 2 of the Stephan Paternot mega-episode right now. This is where
      we get into the meat of it, the good stuff, the whole crazy roller coaster ride
      of being the hottest startup of the dotcom era. And I was going to make this
      the last episode, but as I was editing this, I realized that after we get done
      with this story, Stephan talks a lot about what happens after--- what happens
      after you've been on a crazy ride like this. How you have to reinvent yourself,
      and your life, and your career. He said so many interesting things about that,
      that for the first time ever, we're going to do a part 3, coming in two weeks,
      to talk about the reinvention.
