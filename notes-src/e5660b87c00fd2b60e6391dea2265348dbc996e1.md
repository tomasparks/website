    content: "Legendary computer scientist, web standards pioneer, and indie-web proponent
      Tantek \xC7elik is Jeffrey Zeldman\u2019s guest.\r\n\r\nThe secret history of
      standards in our web browsers. How web standards moved from academic ideas that
      sometimes couldn\u2019t even be implemented to the foundation of our modern
      web. The rift between standards-oriented, CSS-and-accessibility-loving web developers
      and those who rely on powerful and sophisticated toolchains: can it be bridged?\r\n\r\nThe
      Flash years and today. Indieweb tools and the independent web community: what
      it\u2019s about and how to get started. Readers versus social readers. Taking
      back privacy and the ownership of our content.\r\n\r\nhttp://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/186"
