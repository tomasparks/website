    author: Adam Ruins Everything
    content: "Student loans are an absolute necessity for many students in today's
      economy, but they're also among the worst forms of debt you can have, burdening
      students and sometimes permanently crippling their financial lives. Our guest
      Heather Jarvis, who appeared on Adam Ruins College, is going to tell us how
      we got here and give us practical tips on navigating the world of student loans.
      Heather is an attorney and student loan expert. She has practiced public interest
      law for more than a dozen years and has contributed to student debt relief policy
      for the House Education Committee and others in Congress.\r\n\r\nAdam is on
      Twitter @AdamConover and you can find past episodes and bonus content from the
      TruTV show at AdamRuinsEverything.com.\r\n\r\nProduced by Shara Morris for MaximumFun.org."
