    name: The Gawker Debate
    author: Techdirt
    content: Gawker's gone, and that's that. And yet, whenever we've expressed concerns
      over the billionaire vendetta that brought it down, we've faced a huge amount
      of pushback from people who had problems with the site and its reporting practices.
      This week, we're joined by Parker Thompson aka Startup L. Jackson for a friendly
      debate about whether the Gawker shutdown really is a big deal.
