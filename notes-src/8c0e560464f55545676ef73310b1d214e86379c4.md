    name: Barbies v. Bratz
    author: Techdirt
    content: "If you've been reading Techdirt for more than five years, you probably
      remember the conclusion of Mattel v. MGA \u2014 and if you've been reading for
      more than thirteen years, you might even remember when it started. This epic
      legal battle over intellectual property went through nearly a decade of rulings
      and reversals, and the resulting story is a fascinating one that ties in a lot
      of the topics we discuss here at Techdirt. It's also the subject of the new
      book You Don't Own Me by law professor Orly Lobel, who joins us on this week's
      episode to revisit this particular law opera and what it says about the wider
      world of IP."
