    name: What if the Earth stopped spinning?
    author: ABC Radio National
    content: We know that the rotation of the Earth is gradually slowing down. But
      what would happen if God, the devil or aliens suddenly and completely stopped
      our planet from rotating on its axis of spin? Luckily, thanks to improved knowledge
      about our planet, the geographers can now give us the answers.
