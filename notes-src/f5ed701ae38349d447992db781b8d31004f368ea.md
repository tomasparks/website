    name: 174. Bringing the NYTimes and MSNBC Online With Lisa Napoli
    author: internethistorypodcast@gmail.com (Brian McCullough @brianmcc)
    content: "Lisa Napoli got a job straight out of college at CNN in its earliest
      days, which is a crazy startup story in it\u2019s own right. But then she worked
      for a time at Delphi, which was an early online service and competitor to AOL
      and Prodigy that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve covered much here before. And
      then she helped bring the NYTimes online with CyberTimes, which, as she said,
      is forgotten to history even by the New York Times. Then on to MSNBC, a crazy
      hybrid tech and media startup that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve discussed much
      either. There\u2019s just so many great stories here. Please enjoy this conversation
      with Lisa Napoli.\r\n      "
