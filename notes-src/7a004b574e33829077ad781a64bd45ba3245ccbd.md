    name: The Surveillance Economy
    author: Mozilla
    content: "In her new book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Harvard Business
      School\u2019s Shoshana Zuboff argues that tech companies \u2014 like Google
      and Facebook \u2014 collect so much personal data for profit, that they\u2019re
      changing the fundamentals of our economy and way of life. And now these companies
      are learning to shape our behavior to better serve their business goals. Shoshana
      joins Manoush Zomorodi to explain what this all means for us.\n\nWe then explore
      whether or not it\u2019s time to end our relationship with corporate spies.
      OG advice columnist Dear Abby gives us some tips to start with. We chat with
      philosopher S. Matthew Liao. He asks if we have a moral duty to quit Facebook.
      Alice Marwick explains why most people won\u2019t leave the social network.
      And journalist Nithin Coca tells us what it was like for him to quit both Facebook
      and Google. Spoiler alert: it wasn\u2019t easy, but he has no regrets.\n\nIRL
      is an original podcast from Mozilla, maker of Firefox and always fighting for
      you. For more on the series go to irlpodcast.org.\n"
