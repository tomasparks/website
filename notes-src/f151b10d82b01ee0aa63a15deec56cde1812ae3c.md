      Adam Conover)'
    author: HeadGum
    content: "The party ties up some loose ends in Moonstone, then travels to the
      magical city of Ezry in hopes of identifying their cursed sword. Beverly earns
      the nickname \"Bubble Boy,\" Hardwon tastes his first cheeseburger slider, and
      Moonshine uses her crick charm to enlist the help of a bounty hunter. Adam Conover
      (Adam Ruins Everything) joins us for three episodes, starting here! (There won't
      be shout outs at the end of the show this week because we're traveling and scheduled
      the show ahead of time. Shout outs will resume by Ep. 11 and we'll include the
      ones we missed the past couple weeks!) \n\n\n\n\nMusic/Sound Effects include:\n\n\"Scary
      Ambiance\" by ashleyxxpiano at freesound.org."
