    name: TL;DR
    author: Mozilla
    content: "TL;DR: We have access to more things to read than ever before. Too much,
      in fact. Our reading habits have shifted. We skim a lot. We look for full stories
      baked into headlines. Our eyes bounce around from one article to the next, and
      we try and fail to manage how many things we read at once. Some of us can no
      longer concentrate on a book\u2014no matter how good it might be. Reading has
      changed. And we\u2019re changing alongside it.\n\nWith host Manoush Zomorodi,
      Derek Thompson at the Atlantic talks headlines; Ernie Smith from Tedium rails
      against our bad browser tab habits; librarian rock star Nancy Pearl makes the
      case for analog books; Beth Rogowsky discusses if audiobooks can replace reading;
      and Nate Weiner from Mozilla\u2019s Pocket shows us one way we can manage our
      reading overload. Happy New Year \u2014  let\u2019s get working on that \u201CI
      will read more this year\u201D resolution.\n\nIRL is an original podcast from
      Mozilla. For more on the series go to irlpodcast.org\n"
