    content: "Episode #202 \u2013 Insert Disk 2 Special - Instant Remedy (in collaboration
      with 010101 Music)\r\n\r\nSwedish remixing legend Martin Noriander Instant Remedy
      is finally back with a brand-new album - \"Insert Disk 2\" celebrates the 30th
      anniversary of the Amiga brand with a fine selection of arranged game and demoscene
      tracks from the 16-bit era. Episode #202 features tracks from this new album,
      its predecessor, as well as original game music composed by Instant Remedy.\r\n\r\nSays
      Martin: \"When the internet was still young, me and a few classmates discovered
      the HVSC and SIDPLay. All of a sudden it was possible to listen to all those
      great tunes - without the hassle of setting up a real C64 to load the games!
      However, I wanted to add something to the SID music to make it sound fuller
      and suitable for listening on a stereo system. So I started adding some drums,
      bass and other stuff, just for fun. At first, I played these tracks for friends
      only. Remixing game music was not as common back then as it is today. They really
      liked what I had done, so I decided to submit MP3s to some sites--- and so my
      remixes started to spread.\"\r\n\r\nMixed by Jegougou, logo by KF, thank you
      to Instant Remedy, Jan Zottmann and Bobic"
