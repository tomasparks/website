    content: 'The Amateur Episode: Question Not Question, Stumbling into Librarian,
      Emerson College, Zero Sum Games, The Early Web, TEXTFILES.COM as Library, Your
      Amateur Moment. I''ve tried to take a (minor) sour moment and turn it into something
      positive. I also got to give some thoughts on some generalized criticisms that
      are usually subtweeted in my direction, although how much this episode moves
      the needle, I''ll likely never know.  The presentation, by the way, was a lot
      of fun and I got to meet some really great folks who I''d never had the chance
      to meet. I found out about some long-memory examples held up in in the professional
      spheres, and I hope to research those to have what other lessons could have
      learned. Also, lunch was amazing and someone handed me a stack of hard drives.  Also,
      now you know why "Rank Amateur" is in my twitter bio!'
