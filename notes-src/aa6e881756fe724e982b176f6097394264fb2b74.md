    name: 'Space Policy Edition: A Commercial Future for the Space Station?'
    author: The Planetary Society
    content: "After announcing it intends to divest from the International Space Station
      in 2025, NASA quietly released a new report on its transition plans, laying
      out a series of principles that will set the future of U.S. astronauts in low-Earth
      orbit. Can a private entity really take over the space station? Where did this
      idea come from anyway? Will there be new commercial space stations in the near
      future, and will they serve NASA's needs? Also, the confirmation of Jim Bridenstine
      as NASA Administrator. More resources to explore this month\u2019s topics are
      at &nbsp;http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/planetary-radio/show/2018/space-policy-edition-25.html&nbsp;\n
