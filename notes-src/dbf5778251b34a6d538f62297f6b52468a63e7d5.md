    content: 'The Podcasting Episode: What Podcasting Was, What Podcasting Was Again,
      The Downfall, The Rebirth, The Future of Podcasting, Money Matters, Why Do I
      Podcast. Just felt like putting down my thoughts and perspective on Podcasting,
      in advance of the Great Podcast Boom/Bust of 2019-2020. I podcast for a reason,
      and I re-iterate it in this episode: Because when looking to pay off debts,
      I wanted to also produce something beyond selling a shirt or doing a fundraiser
      with nothing else to come of it besides stasis. At 60 episodes, this is quite
      a body of work, and you''ve been inspirational in helping me create it.'
