    name: Checking Out Online Shopping
    author: Mozilla
    content: "When you shop, your data may be the most valuable thing for sale. This
      isn\u2019t just true online \u2014 your data follows you into brick and mortar
      stores now as well. Manoush Zomorodi explores the hidden costs of shopping,
      online and off. Meet Meta Brown, a data scientist who unveils the information
      Amazon captures about you when you make an online purchase; Joseph Turow, who
      discusses how retailers are stripping us of our privacy; and Alana Semuels,
      who talks about becoming a hoarder with the advent of online shopping. Plus,
      learn about a college coffee shop where you can actually buy a drink with your
      data. (Is it worth it?)\n\nIRL is an original podcast from Mozilla. For more
      on the series go to irlpodcast.org\n"
