    name: Luck In Silicon Valley, With Robert Frank
    author: Techdirt
    content: Innovation isn't easy, but success in Silicon Valley involves a bigger
      dose of luck than a lot of entrepreneurs seem prepared to admit. Chance gets
      left out of the economic equation all too often, and this week we're joined
      by Mike's own Econ 101 professor from Cornell, Robert Frank, to discuss the
      role of luck in the world of entrepreneurs and innovation.
