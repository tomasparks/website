    name: The Headphone Jack Apocalypse!
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Yup, we're doing it \u2014 we're tackling the much-derided controversy
      over Apple's decision to remove the analog headphone jack from the iPhone! I
      join this week's episode myself as a guest host, and in truth none of us really
      think it's any kind of \"apocalypse\" \u2014 but none of us are huge fans of
      the move either. We discuss the questionable technical advantages, the looming
      spectre of DRM, and more."
