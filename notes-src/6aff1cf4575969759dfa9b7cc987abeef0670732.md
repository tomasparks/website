    content: "If you're a fan of the Reply All podcast, then you're probably still
      processing the story they told in a recent two-part episode about the insane
      lengths that host Alex Goldman went to track down a phone scammer. If you haven't
      heard the story, and you think you've seen all there is to see on the \"messing
      with scammers\" front--- well, you're in for a surprise. We strongly suggest
      you listen to the Reply All story first \u2014 then listen to our conversation
      with Alex about the whole saga on this week's episode of the Techdirt Podcast.\r\n\r\nReply
