    name: Copyright, Music & 'Theft'
    author: Techdirt
    content: "This week's episode is all about copyright and culture, with a pair
      of the best guests you could ask for on the subject. Almost ten years ago, law
      professors Keith Aoki, James Boyle and Jennifer Jenkins released a comic book
      about copyright called Bound By Law, and now they are back with a sequel: Theft:
      A History of Music. This week, James and Jennifer join us to discuss the new
      comic and the history of copyright and music (with lots of fair use music snippets
      to demonstrate the legacy of 'theft')!\r\n\r\nYou should also be sure to check
      out the comic itself! You can download a digital copy for free of course, but
      for those who want to get their hands on the beautiful paperback edition, we've
      got a limited time offer for Techdirt fans: you can get it for only $8.99 at
      Createspace (that's 40% off!) when you use the discount code 2FESBPRQ within
      the next two weeks. It's also available on Amazon with a free Kindle edition
      included when you buy."
