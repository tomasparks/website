    name: Free Speech & The Marketplace Of Ideas
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Last week, Mike sparked lots of conversation with his post about rethinking
      the marketplace of ideas without losing sight of the importance of the fundamental
      principles of free speech. Naturally, there's plenty more to discuss on that
      topic, so this week we're joined by Buzzfeed general counsel Nabiha Syed \u2014
      whose recent article in the Yale Law Journal, Real Talk About Fake News, offered
      a thorough and insightful look at free speech online \u2014 to try to cut through
      all the simplistic takes on free speech and talk about where things are going.\r\n\r\nMike's
