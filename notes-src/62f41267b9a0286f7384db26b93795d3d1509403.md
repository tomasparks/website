    content: "Episode #212 \u2013 Return of the Phat Elephant\r\n\"This was a blast\",
      they said, and that this was your \"new favourite episode\", too. You cried
      out loud for more after we've released ep#194: Elephat. So we've returned to
      the turntables and will hit you directly in your face again! Harder than ever
      before! So enjoy a new mix of pure dubstep awesomeness coming out directly from
      the sound laboratory of the BitFellas bad boys.\r\nThanks to the Monstercat
      free music catalogue for making this mix elephatastic!\r\nBitFellas - The bass
      belongs to us this night!\r\n\r\nMixed by Vincenzo, compiled by Bobic, logo
