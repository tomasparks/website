    name: Why Are There So Many Messaging Companies?
    author: Techdirt
    content: 'If you want to send someone a message online today, you''ve got a hell
      of a lot of options. Far from the erstwhile IM dominance of ICQ, today there
      are messaging platforms of every shape and size, a blurring of the lines between
      messaging and social media, and messaging components incorporated into almost
      everything. This week, we ask a simple question: why so many, and what are they
      all for?'
