    name: Is "Free" Bad?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "In the last few years, a lot of the conversation around technology in
      general has shifted its focus from excitement about the obvious benefits to
      concern about its downfalls and side effects. It even feels like there's a general
      sense that \"technology is bad for society\" in a lot of places. This comes
      with a lot of associated myths, including the prominent idea that \"if you're
      not paying for something, you're the product being sold\" \u2014 an idea that
      is, at best a massive oversimplification. So on this week's podcast we're discussing
      the changing cultural attitudes towards technology, especially free online services
      and the many myths and misunderstandings about how they operate."
