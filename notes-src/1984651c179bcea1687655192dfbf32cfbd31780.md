    name: 161. Jeff Bussgang on Open Market and early eCommerce
    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: It gets my goat that these days, the history of ecommerce begins and
      ends with Amazon. There were so many companies and big ideas that got us where
      we are today, and one of the most important companies was Open Market. Jeff
      Bussgang is here to tell us the (today) often overlooked story of the earliest
      days of trying to sell stuff on the web. Today, Jeff is a General Partner at
      Flybridge Capital Partners.
