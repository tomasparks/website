    name: Decentralize It
    author: []
    content: "Some people believe that decentralization is the inevitable future of
      the web. They believe that internet users will start to demand more privacy
      and authenticity of information online, and that they\u2019ll look to decentralized
      platforms to get those things. But would decentralization be as utopian as advocates
      say it could be?\r\n\r\nHost Manoush Zomorodi speaks to Eugen Rochko of Mastodon,
      an ad-free alternative to Twitter; Justin Hunter of Graphite docs, a decentralized
      alternative to GoogleDocs; Maria Bustillos who hopes to help eliminate fake
      news online through the Blockchain; David Irvine, the co-founder of MaidSafe
      who plans to make the centralized internet as we know it redundant; and Tom
      Simonite of WIRED, who comments on both the promise and also the pitfalls of
      decentralization.\r\n\r\nhttps://irlpodcast.org/season4/episode6/"
