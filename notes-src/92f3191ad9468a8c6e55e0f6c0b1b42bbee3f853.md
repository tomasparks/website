    name: Net Neutrality, Zero Rating & The Games Internet Providers Play
    author: Techdirt
    content: "The battle for net neutrality seemed like it was over \u2014 but the
      regulations left a loophole open. Unsurprisingly, ISPs quickly started exploiting
      it, offering \"zero rating\" services to do an end-run around true net neutrality.
      Last week's guest Marvin Ammori joins us again this week, to discuss the true
      and imperfect state of net neutrality, and the many games internet providers
      play."
