    name: 148. Don Melton on Apple, Safari, WebKit and Netscape
    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: "Don Melton is popularly known as the father of the Safari web browser
      or WebKit. He\u2019s basically a web browser legend. Not only does Don tell
      us a lot of great stuff about Safari, WebKit, Apple and more, but he was also
      an early Netscape employee, so we get some more great details about that company,
      especially in its later stages."
