    name: Are Tech And Journalism Att Odds With Each Other?
    author: Techdirt
    content: Between Elon Musk's proposal for a website ranking the credibility of
      journalists and Tim Draper blaming the collapse of Theranos on the press (not
      to mention Peter Thiel's attack on Gawker), it feels like there's a war brewing
      between Silicon Valley and journalism. Though the press has some major problems,
      it really seems like tech entrepreneurs are misunderstanding how it works and
      proposing some dangerous ideas. This week, we discuss the tensions between tech
      and journalism, and what will come from the proposals to address it.
