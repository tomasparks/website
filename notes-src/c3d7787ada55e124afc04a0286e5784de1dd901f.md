    name: Should We Break Up Big Tech?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "A few weeks ago, we featured a panel discussion with Mike and others
      at the Lincoln Network's Reboot conference on the podcast. This week we're doing
      something a little different and featuring another panel discussion from that
      conference, but one in which Mike wasn't involved. Instead, it's an interesting
      \u2014 and at times contentious \u2014 debate about one big question: do the
      big tech firms need to be broken up?"
