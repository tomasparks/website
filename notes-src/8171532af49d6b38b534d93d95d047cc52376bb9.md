    content: "Jason Kottke, of kottke.org fame, was one of the early bloggers, one
      of the first bloggers to go pro, and one of the few solo bloggers still going.
      If you know Kottke.org, then you love it. How could you not? If you\u2019ve
      never heard of it, you can thank me later. This episode examines what it means
      to be a publisher on the web for 20 years as well as the discipline required
      to find cool stuff on the web every single day (almost)."
