    name: Virtual Connections
    author: Mozilla
    content: ":'-) Ever wonder why emoticons exist? They popped up in the 1980s to
      make online connections feel a little less digital and a little more personal
      :D. In this episode of IRL, host Veronica Belmont and special guest Peter Rojas
      explore how the Internet is both building and also confusing our relationships
      every day. Chloe Stuart-Ulin gives a first-hand account of her life as a \u201Ccloser\u201D
      for an online-dating service; we hear a dramatic, real-life story about a woman
      who finds her biological parent online; and Emma Brockes talks about how we
      can all maintain humanity while interacting with others on the internet.\n\nIRL
      is an original podcast from Mozilla. For more on the series go to irlpodcast.org\n"
