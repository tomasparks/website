    name: Paid Attention
    author: Mozilla
    content: "There\u2019s a new currency in town (and no, we\u2019re not talking
      about Bitcoin). We\u2019re talking about attention. In this episode of IRL,
      Veronica Belmont and special guest Jane Lytvynenko explore all the ways your
      attention has become worth money on social media. Meet Hamlet the Piggy, an
      Instagram star who is helping her owner cope with epilepsy and also build a
      business; Lisette Calveiro, whose quest for fame online left her spending beyond
      her means; and media theorist Douglas Rushkoff, who discusses what\u2019s behind
      the emerging attention economy.\n\nIRL is an original podcast from Mozilla.
