    author: Brian McCullough
    content: "We\u2019ve had a couple of people come on here to discuss how the New
      York Times got online, but the spiritual yin to their yang is the Wall Street
      Journal and we haven\u2019t done enough to explore their path to embracing the
      internet. It\u2019s worth doing that because they embraced a different model
      from basically day one. Almost alone among the web media pioneers, the Journal
      went the subscription route. So, we\u2019re going to talk to Rich Jaroslovksy,
      who headed the team that brought the Journal online, to see why they went that
      route, to learn about the path to the web and much more."
