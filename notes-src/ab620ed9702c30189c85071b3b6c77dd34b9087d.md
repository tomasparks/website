    name: Is The Economy More Important Than Democracy?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "The economy is important \u2014 very important. But is that because
      it matters in and of itself, or because it's the engine for achieving the things
      we really do care about? Here at Techdirt we've always been strong advocates
      of the free market, but we've never been absolutists about things like regulation,
      and we believe it's very important to explore these issues in detail. This week
      on the podcast we're joined by James Allworth, co-host of the Exponent podcast
      and author of a recent post entitled Prioritizing Economics is Crippling the
      U.S. Economy, to discuss entrepreneurship, democracy, the economy and more.\r\n\r\nRead
