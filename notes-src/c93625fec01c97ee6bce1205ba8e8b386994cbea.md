    name: How MoviePass Makes Money
    author: Techdirt
    content: "The apparent success of MoviePass raises a whole bunch of interesting
      business model questions \u2014 and privacy concerns about the data-harvesting
      portion of that business model add another layer of complexity. So this week,
      we're going back to a good old-fashioned formula for the podcast, and dedicating
      an episode to examining the company in detail and trying to figure out where
      it might be headed."
