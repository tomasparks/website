      to make the web \u2014 and world \u2014 friendlier places. Jhamel Robinson discusses
      how he used social media to organize a massive BBQ in Oakland after a racial
      altercation went viral; Dr. Meredith Clark sheds light on the need for social
      media platforms to hire members of vulnerable communities; Jon Ronson talks
      about snap judgements; Professor Kip Williams speaks to the effects of ostracism
      online and off; and recent high school graduate Natalie Hampton shares her story
      of surviving extreme bullying and what she's doing now to help others.\n\nIRL
