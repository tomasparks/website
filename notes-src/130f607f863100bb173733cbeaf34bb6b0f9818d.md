    content: 'Summer Camp and Computer Camp: Advertisements, Surprise Lake, Devil''s
      Bargain, I''m Gonna Kill You, Food Heist, Computer Tutor, Meal Plan, Williamstown,
      What Pirates, Learning. I recorded this episode a little looser with more emotional
      modulation to see how it comes off. It''s about two different camps I went to
      as a kid, as well as how it all wrapped in with computers and my desires to
      at once escape and be part of something.  I''ve been really enjoying these sessions
      at Beacon Soundworks, who have been dealing with my flexible schedule and near-random
      recording sessions with a truly professional air. Mike, the owner, is a gem;
      I''m delighted to work with him to book these times. I''m getting good feedback
      from folks, and the notes are always appreciated. Thanks for listening, spread
      the word.'
