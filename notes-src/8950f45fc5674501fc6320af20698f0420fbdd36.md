    name: 'Ep 46: Dr. Azra Raza on Mouse Model Misconceptions & Other Ways We Can
      Improve Cancer Research'
    author: Adam Ruins Everything
    content: "When we think of conducting science experiments on subjects, we immediately
      think of mice models. But today's guest, Dr. Azra Raza, who appeared on Adam
      Ruins Science, says there's a more effective way. On the TV show Dr. Raza discussed
      how the mouse model scientists use for their research is actually ineffective;
      even though a medicine might work well on a rodent, the results don't translate
      as well as we thought to humans - especially when it comes to cancer research
      which is what Dr. Raza studies. Even though humans and mice share over 90 percent
      of their DNA with one another, our bodies still differ in numerous ways; we
      metabolize food and medicine differently and humans are significantly bigger
      than mice in size. This wastes money from the limited amount of funding that
      already exists and encourages clinical trials that ultimately go nowhere. On
      the podcast, Dr. Raza proposes a different research method that she has used
      herself, to much success.\r\n\r\nDr. Raza is a Professor of Medicine and Director
      of the MDS Center at Columbia University in New York. Previously she conducted
      her research at Rush University, Chicago, Illinois in 1992, where she was the
      Charles Arthur Weaver Professor in Oncology and Director, Division of Myeloid
      Diseases.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter @AdamConover and you can find past episodes
      and bonus content from the TruTV show at AdamRuinsEverything.com.\r\n\r\nProduced
      by Shara Morris for MaximumFun.org."
