    name: 'Ep. 6: Ambushed (The Moonstone Saga)'
    author: HeadGum
    content: The almost-heroes set up camp with the freshly-rescued and adorably annoying
      Green Teens, then head back into the keep to search for the dragon's egg. Hardwon
      faces off against a beefcake rival, Beverly expands his tooth collection, and
      Moonshine summons a spectral PawPaw.
