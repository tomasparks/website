    author: Ben Gilbert & David Rosenthal
    content: "Acquired wraps up a big few weeks of coverage with not an IPO or an
      M&A or a fundraising round, but what\u2019s still the largest tech exit in recent
      memory: Spotify\u2019s $30B direct public listing. We dive into what it all
      means and how we got here: from Napster to iTunes to Facebook (and even some
      Justin Timberlake thrown in for good measure). Acquired FM is on the scene and
      spinning all the hits from this new wave music industry titan!"
