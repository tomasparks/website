    author: Mark Phoenix and Ben Hutchings
    content: "Coming into this episode I didn't really know much about service workers.
      I assumed there were very specific use cases for them, but Jeremy opened our
      eyes to the fact that they allow access to some very powerful browser features
      and are useful across the board.\n\nWe also spoke about Jeremy's recently released
      A Book Apart Book 'Going Offline', I'm really enjoying it. I can't put it any
      better than Sarah Drasner (https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com), who said:\n\n\"Jeremy
      Keith explains service workers with kindness, clarity, and humour in his new
      book, a must-read for any web developer who wants to learn this exciting new
      API and enable offline experiences for their applications.\"\n\nThe first chapter
      is available as an A List Apart article, link below. \n\nThere were some strong
      Jukebox Entries this time. Jeremy Chose Catastrophe And The Cure by Explosions
      In The Sky, from one of my very favourite albums. Ben chose The Celestial Garden
      by DrumTalk but apparently described a different track in the episode, he's
      a sleep deprived new dad so we'll have mercy on him for that. My pick was Bashed
      Out by This Is The Kit, a lovely bitter sweet track. \n\nJeremy's and Ben's
      tracks are added to the Relative Paths Playlist (https://relativepaths.uk/pl),
      mine goes on the Relative Paths Alt Playlist (http://relativepaths.uk/altpl)
      for tracks with lyrics.\n\nJeremy also plays slide bouzouki for Brighton based
      band Salter Cane. Link to their site is below, I'd definitely recommend giving
      them a listen.\n\nLinks: \nJeremy's Site - https://adactio.com\nGoing Offline,
