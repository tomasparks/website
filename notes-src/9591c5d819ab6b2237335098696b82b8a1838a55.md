    name: 'Episode 3: Twitch'
    author: Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal
    content: Ben and David discuss Amazon's acquisition of Twitch in 2014. Unlike
      previous episodes, this recent acquisition still has a lot of open questions,
      and Amazon hasn't publicly reported growth of Twitch since the purchase. Ben
      and David talk about Justin Kan's original product with Justin.tv, and the transformation
      into the Twitch that Emmett Shear is running today.
