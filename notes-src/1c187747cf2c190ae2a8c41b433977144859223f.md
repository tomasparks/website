    content: "Podcast #479: Becoming a Digital Minimalist\r\n\r\nPracticing minimalism
      with your possessions has been a trend for the past decade, and it can be a
      worthy practice, as long as you use it as a means to greater efficacy outside
      your personal domain, rather than just an end in itself.\r\n\r\nBut there\u2019s
      arguably a minimalism practice that\u2019s even more effective in achieving
      that greater efficacy: digital minimalism.\r\n\r\nMy guest has written the definitive
      guide to the philosophy and tactics behind digital minimalism. His name is Cal
      Newport and this is his third visit to the AoM Podcast. We\u2019ve had him on
      the show previously to discuss his books So Good They Can\u2019t Ignore You
      and Deep Work. Today, we discuss his latest book, Digital Minimalism: Choosing
      a Focused Life in a Noisy World.\r\n\r\nWe begin our conversation discussing
      why digital tech feels so addicting, why Steve Jobs didn\u2019t originally intend
      for the iPhone to become something we check all the time, and why the common
      tips for reducing your smartphone use don\u2019t work and you need to implement
      more nuclear solutions instead. We then discuss the surprising lesson the Amish
      can teach you about being intentional about technology, how cleaning up your
      digital life is like decluttering your house, and why he recommends a 30-day
      tech fast to evaluate what tech you want to let back into your life. Cal then
      makes an argument for why you should see social media like training wheels for
      navigating the web, how to take those wheels off, and why you should own your
      own domain address. We end our conversation exploring what you should do in
      the free time you open up once your digital distractions are tamed, and the
      advanced techniques you can use to take the practice of digital minimalism to
      the next level.\r\n\r\nI think you\u2019ll find this a tremendously interesting
      and important show.\r\n\r\nShow Highlights:\r\nThe problems people are having
      with their smartphone and social media habits \r\nHow connecting online isn\u2019t
      the same as connecting in \u201Creal\u201D life  \r\nSteve Jobs original vision
      for the iPhone \r\nWhen, why, and how did apps become so irresistible?\r\nWhy
      the \u201Clike\u201D button has changed the entire ecosystem of the internet
      (and why to stop!)\r\nHow your brain reacts to social media feedback (and how
      it\u2019s been hijacked)\r\nWhy modest tips and \u201Chacks\u201D for curbing
      our phone use don\u2019t work all that well\r\nWhy Cal advocates for a bigger
      fix \r\nCal\u2019s 3 principles of \u201Cdigital minimalism\u201D\r\nWhat Thoreau\u2019s
      experiment at Walden Pond can teach us about clutter (even of the digital variety)\r\nWhy
      the costs of social media need to be weighed against their benefits \r\nOptimizing
      social media so that it works for you rather than against you \r\nWhat the Amish
      can teach us about adopting new technologies \r\nDecluttering your digital life
      \r\nWhat 30 days off of modern internet tech does for your life and brain\r\nReintroducing
      social media into your life after decluttering\r\nWhy you should keep strict
      rules regarding your social media and phone use\r\nThe value of strenuous, active
      leisure time \r\nAdvanced tactics for implementing digital minimalism \r\n\r\nhttps://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/digital-minimalism-cal-newport/"
