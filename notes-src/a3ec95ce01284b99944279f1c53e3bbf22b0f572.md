    author: Mozilla
    content: "Most website visitors aren\u2019t human. They\u2019re bots. And these
      automated accounts are having serious, real-world impact; from the 2016 election
      to the FCC\u2019s recent, controversial net neutrality vote. Veronica Belmont
      investigates the rise of social media bots with Lauren Kunze and Jenn Schiffer.
      Lisa-Maria Neudert measures how bots influence politics. Butter.ai\u2019s Jack
      Hirsch talks about what happens when your profile is stolen by a political bot.
      Ben Nimmo teaches us how to spot and take down bot armies. And Tim Hwang explores
      how bots can connect us in surprising, and meaningful, new ways.\n"
