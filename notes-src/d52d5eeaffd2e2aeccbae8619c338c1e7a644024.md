    name: 184. GV's Ken Norton
    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: "Ken Norton is a partner at GV, Alphabets venture capital arm, but before
      that, he was a product manager at Google, where he led the development of products
      like Google Docs, Google Calendar and Google Mobile Maps. But he was also early
      at JotSpot which became Google sites, was a product manager at Yahoo, was an
      early employee at CNET and was CTO of Snap, a company probably none of you have
      ever heard of but I\u2019ve been dying to talk about for years. No. Not snapchat.
      The original Snap. The dotcom era snap. "
