    author: Ben Gilbert & David Rosenthal
    content: "If you thought the telecom business was boring, think again! Acquired
      brings you an episode packed with more drama than an entire season of Game of
      Thrones. Starting with a death in the family, we follow a tale of fortunes lost
      and rebuilt, bitter battles between rivals who once worked for each other, and
      at the center of it all, a lesson in the power of stable cashflow businesses.
