    content: "Rosanne Siino has been on my list to talk to from day one of this podcast.
      As you know, I started by reaching out to Netscape folks and Rosanne was the
      head of communications for that very first dotcom company. She saw it all, she
      can give us her take on both the engineering side and the management side, since
      she was uniquely able to observe both. Rosanne and I were recently on a documentary
      series currently airing on A&amp;E in the US, The Untold Story of the 90s. So,
      I reached out, and we recoded this fantastic extended interview about all things
      Netscape and about the very birth of the Internet Era.&nbsp;\r\n      "
