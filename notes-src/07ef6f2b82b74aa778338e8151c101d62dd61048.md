    name: WTF With Tim O'Reilly
    author: Techdirt
    content: "The rapid forward march of technology has long bred two leading camps
      of onlookers: the techno-optimists and the techno-pessimists. Honest people
      on both sides, however, must admit that technological innovation has had both
      positive and negative effects. Internet legend Tim O'Reilly is one of the people
      who think a lot about these issues, and his new book WTF? What's the Future
      and Why It's Up to Us \u2014 which discusses in detail the world that we are
      building with technology \u2014 was released today, and we're pleased to have
      him join us on this week's episode to talk about the book and the future of
      innovation."
