    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: 'Gregg Spiridellis has been making things go viral on the web since before
      the term VIRAL was even a thing. His company, JibJab has been producing web
      videos since the dialup dotcom era, producing hits you might remember such as
      Elf Yourself, Nasty Santa and This Land Is Your Land. JibJab has survived the
      dotcom bust, the coming of broadband, the coming of YouTube, the coming of social
      media and the mobile internet. '
