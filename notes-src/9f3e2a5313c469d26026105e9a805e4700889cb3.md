    name: Disrupting Google
    author: Techdirt
    content: "When a tech company is huge and dominant, it can feel like competing
      with them is impossible. Worse still, it can sometimes feel like innovating
      is impossible, since they might just step in and take over as soon as someone
      executes on a good idea. Once upon a time this was how startups felt about Microsoft,
      while today it's more likely to be Google or Facebook. But no company, no matter
      how mighty, is immune to being disrupted \u2014 and figuring out how is the
      subject of this week's episode."
