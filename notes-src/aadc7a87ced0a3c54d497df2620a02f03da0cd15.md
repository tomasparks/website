    name: 177. NandO.net with Fraser Van Asch
    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: Nando.net was not only a very early experiment in bringing journalism
      to the web, it was also one of those local ISP's that flowered in the era of
      the early 1990s. Fraser Von Asch was not only one of the key players at The
      News & Observer (thus, "NandO") who brought the project to life, he is another
      person who has straddled the media industry between the print and digital eras
      and can give us some amazing insights into the transitions therein--- or lack
      thereof.
