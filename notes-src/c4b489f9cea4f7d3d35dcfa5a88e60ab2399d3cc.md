    author: Techdirt
    content: "We've done it \u2014 we've solved the challenge of content moderation!

      Kate Klonick, law professor and author of the excellent paper The New Governors:
      The People, Rules, and Processes Governing Online Speech, to join us for an
      in-depth discussion about how we got here and why there are no easy or simple
      answers for content moderation."
