    name: Is Your Algorithm Racist?
    author: Techdirt
    content: Algorithms have become a powerful force in the world, but for all the
      impressive good they do, they sometimes show some worrying tendencies. Algorithms
      that discriminate are a problem that nobody's found a solution for yet. This
      week, we discuss why some algorithms appear to be racist, and whether there's
      anything that can be done about it.
