    name: Loud sounds can kill hard drives
    author: ABC Radio National
    content: "In our complex world, the cure can sometimes be as bad as the original
      problem. For example, you would think that if you had a fire in a data centre,
      it would make sense to deprive the fire of oxygen by flooding the room with
      an inert gas. But what if the noise of the escaping gas is loud enough to kill
      the spinning hard drives\u2014potentially causing more damage than the fire?"
