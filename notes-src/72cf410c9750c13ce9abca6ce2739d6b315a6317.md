    name: Status Update
    author: Mozilla
    content: "In this bonus episode, we check in on some of Season One\u2019s stories
      and see how they\u2019ve evolved. Activist Amanda Werner talks about their turn
      as the Monopoly Man at the Equifax hearings, and how to create visibility for
      victims of identity theft. Investigative journalist Marcy Wheeler follows the
      case of hacker Marcus Hutchins, and tries to make sense of why he was arrested.
      Troy Hunt argues that IoT devices need warning labels. And, drumroll, we hear
      back from a troll we sent a cake to last season.\n"
