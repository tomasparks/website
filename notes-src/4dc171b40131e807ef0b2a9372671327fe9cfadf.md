    name: 143. Neil Hunt on the History of Netflix and Netflix Streaming
    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: Neil Hunt is the Chief Product Officer at Netflix. Since he's been at
      Netflix since 1999, not only is he the perfect person to tell us how Netflix
      streaming came about (the technical hurdles, the strategic decisions, etc.)
      but he can also give us the whole history of Netflix, from basically the very
      beginning.
