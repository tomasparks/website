    name: Your Password is the Worst
    author: Mozilla
    content: "Look, we agree with you: passwords are the worst. But you know what
      else is the worst? Someone hacking your account, or big security breaches that
      expose your email, your credit card information, your government-issued identification
      number, and more. We should hold companies accountable for better security,
      but we also need to hold ourselves accountable for having good password hygiene.
      So let's tackle this once and for all. Hear from Buzzfeed's Mat Honan, who endured
      a brutal hack a few years ago when hackers exploited password-recovery tools;
      Mark Wilson from Fast Company, who wants to ban passwords altogether (though
      admits it's not the best idea); Masha Sedova of Elevate Security who says that,
      yes, security companies have failed us \u2013 but we have to use passwords anyway;
      and Matt Davey of 1Password, who offers a solution that Mozilla can get behind:
      use a password manager. A simple, game-changing tool that will help you take
      back control of your accounts, and secure yourself as best as you can.\n\nIRL
      is an original podcast from Mozilla. For more on the series go to irlpodcast.org\n"
