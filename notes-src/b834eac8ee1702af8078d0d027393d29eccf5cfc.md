    name: There's Always Something New To Learn About Copyright
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Copyright is a big, complicated monster of a law, composed of patchwork
      updates and shaped by international agreements \u2014 which is, in fact, the
      source of a lot of its problems. But fixing copyright means understanding it,
      so this week we've got a conversation with UCLA professor Neil Netanel, author
      of the new book Copyright: What Everyone Needs To Know, because there's always
      something new to learn about copyright."
