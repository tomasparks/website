    name: The Past & Future Of Section 230
    author: Techdirt
    content: Of all the laws we discuss here at Techdirt, probably none comes up as
      often or in relation to as many things as Section 230 of the Communications
      Decency Act. It's not an exaggeration to describe it the way Professor Jeff
      Kosseff does in the title of his new book, The Twenty-Six Words That Created
      The Internet, offering a detailed history of this vital piece of law. This week,
      Jeff joins us on the podcast for an in-depth discussion about where Section
      230 came from, and where it's going.
