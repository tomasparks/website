    author: Mozilla
    content: "We\u2019ve long heard that the ways the web is tailored for each user\u2014how
      we search, what we\u2019re shown, who we read and follow\u2014 reinforces walls
      between us. Veronica Belmont investigates how social media can create and can
      break our filter bubbles. Megan Phelps-Roper discusses the Westboro Baptist
      Church, and the bubbles that form both on and offline. B.J. May talks about
      the bubbles he encountered every day, in his Twitter feed, and tells us how
      he broke free. Rasmus Nielsen suggests social media isn\u2019t the filter culprit
      we think it is. And, within the context of a divided America, DeRay McKesson
      argues that sometimes bubbles are what hold us together.\n"
