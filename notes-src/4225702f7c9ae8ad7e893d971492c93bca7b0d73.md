    name: Should Internet Companies Sway Elections?
    author: Techdirt
    content: 'Recently, some Facebook staffers raised an interesting question: should
      the social media giant employ its significant power to stem the rise of Donald
      Trump? This week, we discuss that notion and the broader question: should the
      internet companies that influence so many aspects of our communication and information
      gathering pursue political goals?'
