    name: 193. The Home Page Film With Doug Block
    author: Brian McCullough
    content: "20 years ago, the acclaimed documentarian Doug Block released a landmark
      film, Home Page. Doug\u2019s documentary accidentally chronicled the birth of
      blogging, featuring several people we\u2019ve talked to on this very show, including
      Justin Hall. But the documentary also captured a moment in time, the web going
      mainstream, the beginnings of the dotcom bubble, the early days of Wired, Hotwired
      and Suck and also so many of the things I ask people about on here regularly.
      How people learned to live online, to begin to port all of modern life over
      to the digital. Well, Home Page is celebrating its 20th anniversary with a re-release,
      and starting this week, you can watch it yourself everywhere films are gettable,
      including iTunes. Today we speak to Doug Block about this amazing movie that
      I think is one of the best historical records of the era we have been interrogating
      for nearly 5 years on this podcast. Go watch Home Page yourself, and check out
      The D-word, Doug\u2019s community for documentarians, at D-word.com."
