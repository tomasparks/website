    name: Games That Tell Stories
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Gaming is changing the nature of storytelling. Video games of course
      \u2014 but also the modern rise of board games, tabletop RPGs and other forms
      of analog gaming. A good game does more than just arbitrarily pair play with
      a veneer of narrative, it marries the mechanics and the ideas to enable interesting
      new ways of conveying and exploring complex ideas. This week, we're joined by
      game designer Randy Lubin to discuss how games can tell stories in a way nothing
      else can."
