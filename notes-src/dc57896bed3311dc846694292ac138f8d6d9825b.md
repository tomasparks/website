    content: The latest entrant on the decentralized transportation scene is the suddenly-ubiquitous
      electric scooters that are taking over San Francisco and other cities. Their
      appearance has triggered the inevitable controversy, with some saying they are

      a regulatory battle wasn't far behind. On this week's episode, we discuss the
      e-scooter trend and its many pros and cons.
