    name: Death Knell For Software Patents
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Software patents have been dubious since their inception \u2014 not
      just in principle, but legally too. Past rulings have called their validity
      into serious question, and now an opinion from a prominent pro-patent judge
      has called for people to admit that they simply shouldn't exist. This week,
      we discuss what this opinion means for the (hopefully short) future of software
      patents."
