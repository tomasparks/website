    name: Why This ISP Supports Net Neutrality, Privacy Rules And More
    author: Techdirt
    content: Since Congress threw out new privacy rules for ISPs that were supposed
      to come into effect soon, there's been a renewed uproar on all sides of the
      debate about internet regulation. While the big ISPs generally want to be able
      to do as they please, there are smaller service providers out there that fully
      understand and embrace the need for privacy, net neutrality and more. One such
      ISP is Sonic, and this week we're joined by CEO Dane Jasper to discuss why these
      rules are a good thing.
