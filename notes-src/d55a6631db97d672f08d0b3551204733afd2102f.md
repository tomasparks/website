    name: Is It Bad If Facebook Copies Everything Snapchat Does?
    author: Techdirt
    content: 'You may have heard the joke: the best way to do product design for Facebook
      is to get a job at Snapchat. We''ve all seen how, after failing to buy the company,
      Facebook has wasted little time in building its own versions of most of Snapchat''s
      key features. So--- is this a problem? That''s the subject on this week''s episode,
      were we discuss the ins and outs of this kind of copying and what it might mean
      for the future of social media.'
