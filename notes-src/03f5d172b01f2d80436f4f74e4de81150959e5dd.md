    name: Autonomous Cars Are Accelerating
    author: Techdirt
    content: The adoption of self-driving cars is rapidly changing from science fiction
      to present reality. We had a preliminary discussion on the subject here on the
      podcast a couple years ago, but today we're digging more deeply the impact this
      is having, especially on policy. R Street Institute senior fellow Ian Adams
      joins us as a special guest this week for a discussion about the many implications
      of this accelerating technological shift.
