      summary:
      - "\"You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain,
        but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong
        with the world [wide web].\" \u2014 Morpheus, The Matrix \nWhatever the reason,
        you're done with sharecropping your content, your identity, and your self.\n
        Our online content and identities are becoming more important and sometimes
        even critical to our lives. Neither are secure in the hands of random ephemeral
        startups or big silos. We should be the holders of our online presence."
