    name: The Grand Re-Opening Of The Public Domain
    author: Techdirt
    content: As our readers surely know by now, 2019 is the first time in a long time
      that new works have actually entered the public domain in the US! The Internet
      Archive and Creative Commons hosted a celebration of this fact, and this week
      we're joined by IA's Lila Bailey and CC's Timothy Vollmer to talk about that
      event and the exciting possibilities of a re-opened public domain.
