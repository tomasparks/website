    name: 157. Rob Malda (@cmdrtaco) on SlashDot and Social Media
    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: You might know him as Rob Malda, or you might know him as CmdrTaco, but
      he was the founder of the great geek social website Slashdot. Slashdot recently
      turned 20 years old, Rob commemorated this in a great Medium post, and so I
      reached out to him to tell us the story of one of the first great social media
      websites.
