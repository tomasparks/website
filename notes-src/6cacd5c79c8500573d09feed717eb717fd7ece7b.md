    content: 'The Kickstarter Episode: Successful Sabbatical, Starting a Three-Pack,
      What Happened, A Job To Be Me, The Sacrifice, The End, The Loot, The Beginning.
      After a lot of thought and a number of sleepless nights, I ended the kickstarter
      campaign that I''ve had running for seven years. I thought I would talk about
      what inspired me to go about it in the first place, what went wrong, and what
      I''ve learned.'
