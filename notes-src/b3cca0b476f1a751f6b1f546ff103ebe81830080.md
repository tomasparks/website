    name: 'Ep 45: Dr. Kathryn Hall on the Surprising Power of Placebos'
    author: Adam Ruins Everything
    content: "Placebos are commonly dismissed as \"fake\" treatments that have no
      real power on you or your body. But scientists are realizing more and more that
      placebos are more powerful than we realized. New research shows that while placebos
      may not cure diseases, they can reduce symptoms of our ailments like irritable
      bowel syndrome and even Parkinson's disease, and in the process actually make
      us feel better. Even traditional medicine takes advantage of the placebo effect,
      which could mean the placebo effect could play a significant role in treating
      diseases. On this episode we talk to Dr. Kathryn Hall, who appeared on Adam
      Ruins Spa Day, about how placebos can have such powerful effects on our brains
      and how placebos are changing the way we conduct science and treat patients.
      Kathryn is a molecular biologist and Director of Placebo Genetics at Harvard
      Medical School's Program in Placebo Studies.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter @AdamConover
      and you can find past episodes and bonus content from the TruTV show at AdamRuinsEverything.com.\r\n\r\nProduced
      by Shara Morris for MaximumFun.org."
