    content: 'The Cowicature Episode: I Needed the Money, Two Pens and Paper, Sketch
      the Cow, Harvard Square, Territories, No Woman No Cry, What Caricatures Are,
      Very Little Udder Assault, The Clown, Street Vendor Shutdown.  I spent a couple
      summers doing caricatures for money out as a street performer. Here''s my thoughts
      on that. Before anybody asks, this sort of skill atrophies incredibly quickly,
      so I can''t do it any more (people have tried to get me to do it). I took the
      time that would have been spent on my artist game and moved into movie making
      and computers, and while it''s sad I let that talent go, I did some other good
      stuff with it!  I idly looked up how street performing did after we got flushed
      out, and it turns out that this year, this year, they just changed the rules
      and policies regarding performing and fees and technically, I could start up
      again! (But I''m not going to: Kind of busy.)'
