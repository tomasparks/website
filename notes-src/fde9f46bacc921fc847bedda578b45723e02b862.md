    author: Techdirt
    content: "Lots of people have tried to sum up the differences between Silicon
      Valley and Washington, D.C. \u2014 but it isn't so easy to hone in on. Nevertheless,
      it's clear that at least some aspects of the west-coast tech approach could
      benefit a government that all-too-often appears incapable of accomplishing anything
      much. This week, we're joined by former US Deputy Chief Technology Officer and
      Code For America founder Jennifer Pahlka to discuss what the Hill can learn
      from the Valley."
