      Video Games'
    author: Adam Ruins Everything
    content: "Do you remember all of those video games that were made for girls back
      in the 90s? Well they're not being archived the same way that stereotypical
      boy games are being preserved. They don't have value in the gaming community
      and many of these games are being forgotten even though they were just as creative
      and innovative for the industry. Our guest Rachel Weil is trying to change that
      by preserving these 'girl' games by going around the world and collecting these
      games and talking to the people who made them. She is a software developer for
      Microsoft and the founder of the Femicom Museum,  a hybrid physical/digital
      museum and archive dedicated to the preservation and reimagination of femininity,
      girlhood, and the aesthetics of cute within twentieth-century video games, computing,
      and electronic toys. Rachel did not appear on the Adam Ruins Everything TV show
      but her work reminded us of the themes we explored in our Adam Ruins Summer
      Fun episode. And since we're in the off-season of the TV show, we'll be inviting
      more guests onto the podcast whose work relates to themes we explored on the
      TV show or who are doing fascinating work or research that's worth discussing
      anyway. On the podcast Adam and Rachel had a lively discussion about gender
      expectations, the negative effects of marketing towards girls and boys, their
      favorite classic games and even their favorite savory breakfasts.\r\n\r\nAdam
      is on Twitter @AdamConover and you can find past episodes and bonus content
      from the TruTV show at AdamRuinsEverything.com.\r\n\r\nProduced by Shara Morris
      for MaximumFun.org"
