    author: Techdirt
    content: "Have you ever thought about the legal issues surrounding emoji? Don't
      worry, most people haven't. But they are myriad and interesting, with roots
      nearly two decades ago following the emergence of emoticons \u2014 and two people
      who definitely have thought a lot about it are Eric Goldman and Gabriella Ziccarelli,
      who join us on this week's episode to talk about the various intersections of
      emoji and the law."
