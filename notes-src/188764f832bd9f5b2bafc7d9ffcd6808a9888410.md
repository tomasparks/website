    name: Government, Activism & Silicon Valley
    author: Techdirt
    content: "In late September, Mike joined a panel at the Lincoln Network's Reboot
      conference to tackle the question \"will rising activism limit government\u2019s
      access to Silicon Valley?\" along with Trae Stephens, Pablo E. Carrillo, with
      moderator Katie McAuliffe. For this week's episode, we've got the full audio
      from that panel plus an additional introduction from Mike with some thoughts
      after the fact. Enjoy!"
