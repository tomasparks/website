    name: Can The Blockchain Save Publishers?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "After the recent launch of po.et, which aims to use the blockchain to
      create a new business model for digital media companies, Mike was--- unconvinced.
      This led to a Twitter discussion with CEO Jarrod Dicker, which in turn led to
      a longer in-person conversation about the ideas behind the service and where
      it might go \u2014 and you can listen to the whole thing on this week's podcast
      episode."
