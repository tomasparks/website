    name: Is There A Better Way To Pick A President?
    author: Techdirt
    content: 'Well, today''s the day. By tomorrow there will be a new President of
      the United States, and a large segment of the population claiming that they
      were robbed by the system. But immediate anger aside, that system is hardly
      above criticism: the Electoral College has had all sorts of unanticipated and
      often undesirable effects on democracy, and a wide variety of alternatives have
      been proposed. This week we discuss the question: is there a better way to pick
      the president?'
