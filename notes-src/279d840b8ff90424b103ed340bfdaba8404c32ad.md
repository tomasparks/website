    content: "Plato was an online and interactive learning computer system developed
      in the 1960s at the University of Illinois. But in the early 1970s, Plato got
      truly networked, and the users took over. Plato had already pioneered such things
      as touch screen computing, but the kids introduced and pioneered concepts like
      forums, message boards, e-mail, chat rooms, instant messaging, multiplayer games
      and even emoticons/emojis were pioneered on the Plato system.\r\n\r\nBuy The
