    name: 192. Hulu's Founding and Digital Design With Dan Maccarone
    author: Brian McCullough
    content: Dan Maccarone is a digital design veteran, websites, products, strategy.
      He's got some amazing stories about the dotcom bubble, about the aftermath,
      and the rise of Web 2.0. He shares some unique design lessons but also, the
      story of the birth of Hulu, which I don't think has really been covered anywhere
      before.
