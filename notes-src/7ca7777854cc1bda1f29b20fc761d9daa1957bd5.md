    name: Building Communities Outside Facebook
    author: Techdirt
    content: "One thing we've talked about for a long time at Techdirt is the importance
      communities for media outlets, including our own. These days, it feels like
      a lot of media companies are giving up on this work altogether and outsourcing
      it to social media platforms \u2014 but that means foregoing some of the most
      powerful aspects of the internet. This week, we're joined by Josh Millard, who
      recently took over MetaFilter, to talk about building online communities and
      not relying on Facebook."
