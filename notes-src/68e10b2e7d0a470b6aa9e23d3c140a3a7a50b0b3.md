    name: The Phone Phreak Episode
    author: Jason Scott
    content: 'The Phone Phreak Episode: The Woods, To All Who Dare, Phreak Philes,
      The Office, My Ship In The Darkness, The Next Generation, Exploding the Phone.
      I really push the book "Exploding the Phone" by Phil Lapsley in this episode.
      If you''ve not heard of it or you''ve always been on the fence about it--- if
      the history of Phreaking interests you, this is the book.'
