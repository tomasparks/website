    name: Who Still Needs A Personal Computer?
    author: Techdirt
    content: 'As smartphones and other mobile devices have gotten smarter and smarter,
      they''ve taken over more and more of most people''s general computing needs,
      and the importance of the classic personal computer has waned. And so for some
      time the question has been: will the PC ever go away entirely? That''s our topic
      this week as we try to figure out who really needs a PC these days, and when
      and if that will change.'
