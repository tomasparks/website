    name: Re-Decentralizing The Web
    author: Techdirt
    content: One of the fundamental strengths of the internet has always been its
      decentralization, but over time we've seen a bunch of different forces start
      to distort this setup. This week, we're joined by Jamie King, director of Steal
      This Film and host of the Steal This Show podcast to discuss the ongoing efforts
      to restore the decentralization of the web.
