    name: No, The MP3 Isn't Dead
    author: Techdirt
    content: "When the \"death of the MP3\" started being reported, we were among
      the very few blogs that said umm, no \u2014 but the deluge of eulogies for the
      still-thriving format has been overwhelming and quite surprising. This week
      I join the podcast to discuss why the MP3 isn't dead, and how so much of the
      tech press got it so wrong."
