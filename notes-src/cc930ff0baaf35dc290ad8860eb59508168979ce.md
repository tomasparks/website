    name: Hacking The Patent System
    author: Techdirt
    content: "We all know the patent system is riddled with problems, and badly in
      need of reform. But reform comes slow \u2014 really, really slow. So some tech
      companies have been doing what they do best: innovate. They are finding ways
      to get around the biggest problems of the patent system without waiting on go-nowhere
      legislative reform efforts. This week we're joined by Julie Samuels, President
      of the Board at Engine, to discuss the innovation-based approach to navigating
      the patent system and changing patent culture."
