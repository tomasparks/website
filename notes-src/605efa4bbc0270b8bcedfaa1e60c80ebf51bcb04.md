    name: Debating The Facebook Filter Bubble, With Mathew Ingram
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Though the notion of the Facebook \"filter bubble\" has been around
      for a while, it's picked up a huge amount of steam following the election of
      Donald Trump \u2014 perhaps just a little too much steam. While Techdirt has
      long been of the opinion that pointing fingers at Facebook is misguided, there
      are plenty of people who disagree. This week, we're joined by one such person
      \u2014 long-time media commentator and senior editor at Fortune Mathew Ingram
      \u2014 for a lively debate about just how much of a problem the filter bubble
      really is, and how you'd go about solving it."
