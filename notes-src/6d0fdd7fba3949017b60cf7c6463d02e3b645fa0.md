    name: Building New Senses (Plus The Possible End Of The World)
    author: Techdirt
    content: This week, we've got a special cross-post from Rob Reid's excellent After
      On podcast. After a conversation between Mike and Rob about the possible end
      of the world, we pivot to the full episode of After On in which Rob talks to
      neuroscientist David Eagleman about his fascinating work using technology to
      create new human senses. We hope you enjoy it!
