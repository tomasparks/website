    name: Can Journalism Survive A Free Market?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "It's no secret that journalism outfits are struggling, and have been
      for some time. There are lots of competing ideas about why this is the case,
      and who to blame, but the ultimate question is the same: how do we fund good
      journalism going forward? This week, Mike is joined on the podcast by someone
      whose opinions on this question differ significantly from his own \u2014 Columbia
      Journalism professor and former online editor-in-chief of the Guardian Emily
      Bell \u2014 to talk about whether journalism can survive the free market, and
      what the alternatives are."
