    name: What if women built the internet?
    author: Mozilla
    content: "All the things we love on the internet \u2014 from websites that give
      us information to services that connect us \u2014 are made stronger when their
      creators come with different points of view.  With this in mind, we asked ourselves
      and our guests: \"What would the internet look like if it was built by mostly
      women?\"\n\nWitchsy founders Kate Dwyer and Penelope Gazin start us off with
      a story about the stunt they had to pull to get their site launched \u2014 and
      counter the sexist attitudes they fought against along the way. Brenda Darden
      Wilkerson recalls her life in tech in the 80s and 90s and shares her experience
      leading AnitaB.org, an organization striving to get more women hired in tech.
      Coraline Ada Ehmke created the Contributor Covenant, a voluntary code of conduct
      being increasingly adopted by the open source community. She explains why she
      felt it necessary, and how it's been received; and Mighty Networks CEO Gina
      Bianchini rolls her eyes at being called a \"lady CEO,\" and tells us why diversifying
      the boardroom is great for business and innovation.\n"
