    content: "Summary:\r\nRobert Reid, the founder of Rhapsody, can be considered
      the Godfather (founding father?) of the streaming music reality we now live

      Robert is the author of a book that was probably one of the biggest reasons
      I started doing this podcast. The book was Architects of the Web, 1000 Days
      that Built the Future of Business. It was one of the first books to come out
      about the history of the web era. It was published in 1997, "
