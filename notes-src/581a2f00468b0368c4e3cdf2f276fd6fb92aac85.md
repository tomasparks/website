    name: Does Pharma Really Need Patents?
    author: Techdirt
    content: 'It doesn''t take many stories of people suffering due to unaffordable
      medicine to make you question the state of pharmaceutical patents, but the arguments
      in their defense are loud and frequent. Most are variations on the same theme:
      without the promise of a monopoly, important drugs would never be researched
      and developed. But does this argument truly hold up? It''s come up as a tangent
      in previous episodes of the podcast, but this week we''re dedicating a full
      episode to questioning the popular defenses of pharma patents and looking for
      a better way forward.'
