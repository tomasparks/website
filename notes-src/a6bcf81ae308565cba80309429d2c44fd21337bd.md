    content: "From Google search to Facebook news, algorithms shape our online experience.
      But like us, algorithms are flawed. Programmers write cultural biases into code,
      whether they realize it or not. Author Luke Dormehl explores the impact of algorithms,
      on and offline. Staci Burns and James Bridle investigate the human cost when
      YouTube recommendations are abused. Anthropologist Nick Seaver talks about the
      danger of automating the status quo. Safiya Noble looks at preventing racial
      bias from seeping into code. And Allegheny County\u2019s Department of Children
      and Family Services shows us how a well-built algorithm can help save lives.\n"
