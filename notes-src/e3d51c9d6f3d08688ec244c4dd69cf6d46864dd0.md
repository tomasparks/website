    name: Rob Reid's Mind-Bending Podcast
    author: Techdirt
    content: "We've talked about author Rob Reid many times on Techdirt, and had him
      on the podcast once before. Now, in what started as a project to promote his
      latest novel, Reid is hosting a podcast called After On, which tackles some
      pretty crazy real-world topics \u2014 from alien life to mind-reading technology
      \u2014 befitting a science fiction writer. This week, he returns to our podcast
      to discuss what it's like interviewing big thinkers about mind-bending ideas."
