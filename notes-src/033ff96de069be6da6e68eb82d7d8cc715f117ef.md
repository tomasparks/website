      Shave Club
    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: "David Pakman is a well respected venture capitalist at Venrock, but
      also a lifelong musician and music fan. Earlier in his career he played a significant
      role in bringing music to the web. David tells us about cofounding Apple\u2019s
      Music Group, his role in facilitating the first digital sales of music online
      at dotcom-era companies N2K and MyPlay, and competing directly against iTunes
      when he was at eMusic. As a bonus, he gives us some background on the more recent
      founding story of Dollar Shave Club."
