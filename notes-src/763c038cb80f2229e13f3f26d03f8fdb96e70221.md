    content: "\_ When the Door Rolls Up, The Last Cache of Commodore, One More Time
      About the Manuals, Rusted Amigas, Money Money Money, The Meaning of it All.
      A pleasant enough essay about the nature of piles of \"stuff\" I get offered
      or that fall into my lap. Why does this happen? What are my thoughts on it?
      Here's a good starting overview of this aspect of history. I will say that the
      Great Patreon Stumble of 2017 has encouraged me to decentralize this podcast
      and contributions, which I bet will be good for me in the long run - so there's
      a silver lining. More than a few people are asking me to consider adding interview
      episodes to this podcast. I'd honestly like to ask you all what you think of
      that. I assume it'd be me and someone interesting talking for an hour, and then
      turning that into something smooth. It sure wouldn't be 20 minutes, and I am
      of the opinion it's basically another whole type of show. Maybe a bonus scattered
      here and there? I just don't see how it fits in the format and folks who like
      the sub-30-minutes running time will find themselves really behind. Well, let
      me know.  \_ \_"
