    name: What Happened At The Oracle Google Trial?
    author: Techdirt
    content: Over the past few weeks, a jury heard the second round of the copyright
      fight between Oracle and Google over whether Google's use of the Java APIs in
      Android constituted copyright infringement, or whether it was fair use.  In
      the end, the jury went with fair use.  Reporter Sarah Jeong watched the entire
      trial from the courtroom and joins us on the Techdirt podcast this week to discuss
      both the legal details and the various oddities of this particular trial.
