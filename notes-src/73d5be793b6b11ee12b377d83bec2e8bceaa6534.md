    name: Debating Steam's New Hands-Off Policy
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Recently, Valve sent waves through the PC gaming world by announcing
      an upcoming policy change for its Steam platform: it will no longer enforce
      specific content rules and will allow all games as long as they aren't illegal
      or \"straight-up trolling\". Though it's not exactly clear what this means,
      the reaction from the gaming press has been largely negative, and it's hard
      to say how the new policy will be implemented \u2014 so this week myself, Tim
      Geigner and Cathy Gellis join the podcast to discuss just what's going to happen
      on the biggest platform for PC games."
