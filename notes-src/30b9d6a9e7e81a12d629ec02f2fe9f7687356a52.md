    name: AI, Free Speech & Human Rights
    author: Techdirt
    content: As artificial intelligence technology marches onwards, it's raising a
      lot of complicated questions about free speech, privacy, and important rights.
      One person who's been thinking a lot about these questions is David Kaye, the
      UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom
      of opinion and expression, who recently published a thorough report [pdf] on
      the subject. This week, David joins us on the podcast to discuss artificial
      intelligence and its implications for human rights.
