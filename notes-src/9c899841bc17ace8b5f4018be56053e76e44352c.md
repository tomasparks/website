    name: Life Insurance, Life Surveillance
    author: Techdirt
    content: A major insurance company recently announced that it would offer discounts
      on life insurance to customers who wear activity trackers and log data showing
      they live a healthy lifestyle. This understandably freaked out some people,
      but there are interesting aspects to the idea as well. There's plenty to consider,
      so this week regular hosts Mike, Hersh and Dennis discuss whether this is an
      exciting innovation, a worrying expansion of surveillance culture, or both.
