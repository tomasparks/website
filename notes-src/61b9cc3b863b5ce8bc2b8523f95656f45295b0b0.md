    name: Can We Really Colonize Mars?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Elon Musk got plenty of attention recently for announcing his plans
      to colonize Mars. But that's not exactly a new idea \u2014 so we wondered if
      it was really a different, exciting and realistic plan, or just a reiteration
      of the standard far-flung dream. To answer that question, we brought in three
      experts: Amy Shira Teitel (a space and flight historian and creator of YouTube's
      Vintage Space videos), JPL's Fred Calef (a Mars geologist and \"keeper of the
      maps\" for Mars rovers), and the New Space Intiative's Tanya Harrison (who worked
      on Curiosity and several other Mars missions). The result was a fascinating
      discussion about Mars and whether or not we're actually headed there any time
      soon."
