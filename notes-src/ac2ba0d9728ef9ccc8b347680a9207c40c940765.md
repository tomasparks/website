    content: 'The 50th Episode: A Short Review of How We Got Here, What the Podcast
      Has Done For Me, Another Kind of 50, 50 More, Thank You. 50 podcast episodes
      have been released for this series. It''s a milestone, and something I''m happy
      to have been part of for the last year and a half. Thank you for supporting
      this and helping me dig out of the mess and get straight in a financial way.  As
      I say in the episode, I''m continuing this podcast until it doesn''t make sense
      to, or when I run out of what to talk about. Taking bets on which of those happen
      first.  Thank you again.'
