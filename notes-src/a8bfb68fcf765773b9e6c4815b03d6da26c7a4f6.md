    name: The Perils Of Internet Platform Regulation
    author: Techdirt
    content: "We've been talking about internet platform regulation for a long time,
      but in the past year these issues have gotten a huge amount of increased focus
      \u2014 for a bunch of fairly obvious reasons. But a lot of people who are fairly
      new to the issue tend to make a lot of questionable assumptions and jump to
      some problematic conclusions, so this week we're joined by someone who has been
      studying these questions for many years \u2014 Annemarie Bridy, a law professor
      at the University of Idaho and Affiliate Scholar at the Stanford University
      Center for Internet and Society \u2014 to discuss the complicated consequences
      of various attempts to regulate online platforms."
