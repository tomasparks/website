    name: Charter Cities & Innovative Governance
    author: Techdirt
    content: "We're pretty optimistic about innovation here at Techdirt, but it isn't
      an automatic good thing all by itself: implementation and intention matters,
      and that means political entanglements and complicated questions about governance,
      and that calls for big, new ideas. This week, we're joined by Tamara Winter
      from the Center for Innovative Governance Research to discuss new experiments
      in government like charter cities and special autonomous zones.\r\n\r\nAlso,
