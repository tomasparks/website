    name: 'Chatbots: Fad Or The Future?'
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Chatbots have been around for a very long time in some form or another,
      but now they appear to be making a comeback \u2014 or at least attempting one.
      This week, Mike and regular co-host Dennis (who is working on a chatbot startup)
      are joined by special guest Veronica Belmont to discuss the potential of chatbots
      and just how much skepticism is warranted."
