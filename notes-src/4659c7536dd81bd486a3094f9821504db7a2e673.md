    name: The User Group Episode
    author: Jason Scott
    content: 'The User Group Episode: Mark''s Childhood Flight Simulator, 48 hours,
      User Groups, RIAG, CACHE, Finding Cohorts, Emulation Casualties, The Darkest
      Outlook.  Some thoughts on user groups and software, all based on a pretty good
      success story trying to find a flight simulator for a co-worker. All ending
      in a natural place: the inherent existential threat of technology. Thanks everyone
      who has been supporting me this whole time, by the way. It''s taken such a load
      off.'
