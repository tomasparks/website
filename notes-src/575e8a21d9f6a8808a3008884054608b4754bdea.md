    content: "Episode #216 \u2013 Best Compo Tracks from 20 years of Evoke\r\nTwo
      decades of Evoke--- Oh boy, that means countless hours of great compo music
      and the birth of many genius and creative talents. Artists who know how to deliver
      a great listening experience or who successfully experimented in a silly and
      funny way. Long before KEVIN we heard about a fountain called Jockel. We learned
      that Paniq doesn't need any instruments for making music. Enjoying phat beats
      from glxblt, Bitch or dq was as awesome as hearing the comeback of legendary
      BitArts. Also don't forget Crome, who can do the chip-style as good as heavy
      metal music. These all are moments we'd like to share with you again in this
      episode, featuring the best compo tracks from 20 years of Evoke!\r\n\r\nMixed
