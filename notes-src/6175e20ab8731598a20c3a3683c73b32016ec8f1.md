    author: Techdirt
    content: "Normally, we wouldn't dedicate a whole episode of the podcast to talking
      about a single app \u2014 but every now and then something small comes along
      that contains innovations worth exploring. So this week, we're taking a look
      at the hit trivia app HQ, which is one of the first new things in recent memory
      to gain real momentum with \"appointment viewing\"."
