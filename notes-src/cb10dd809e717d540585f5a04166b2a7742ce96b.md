    name: Teaching The Law Via Podcasts
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Law isn't simple, and truly learning about it takes more than a few
      short primers or even an in-depth guide or two \u2014 which makes it the perfect
      topic to explore via the medium of podcasts. This week, we've got a pair of
      guests who are doing exactly that: Ken White of Popehat fame, who recently launched
      the Make No Law podcast about First Amendment issues, and Elizabeth Joh, co-host
      of the What Trump Can Teach Us About Constitutional Law podcast. Instead of
      picking their brains about the law itself, we've got an episode all about their
      experience using podcasts to teach people about legal issues."
