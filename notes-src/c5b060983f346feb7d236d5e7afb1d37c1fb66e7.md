    content: "The Acting Episode: Johannes and a Restaurant, Electricity and Christmas
      Lights, Acting, Pages, Out of Order, Tourist Trap, Editing. The Wikipedia entry
      for the film is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Je_Suis_Auto\_ While editing
      up the episode, I'm not 100% sure I make clear that the primary director of
      the \"Je Suis Auto\" film is Juliana Neuhuber (https://www.juliananeuhuber.com/)
      and Johannes is co-director but mostly in the role of main actor and writer.
      Johannes (and I and others) had ideas but Juliana was the final word on set.
      The casino/tourist trap I mentioned is called Excalibur City and the home page
      for it is here: http://www.excaliburcity.com/en/ \_"
