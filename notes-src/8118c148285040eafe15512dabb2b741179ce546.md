    name: The EU Endangers Free Speech Online--- Again
    author: Techdirt
    content: "The latest in the EU's string of internet regulatory efforts has a new
      target: terrorist propaganda. Just as with past regulations, the proposed rules
      seem onerous and insane, creating huge liability for internet platforms that
      fail to do the impossible. This week, we're joined by returning guests Daphne
      Keller from Stanford's Center For Internet And Society and Emma Llans\xF3 from
      the Center for Democracy and Technology to discuss this most recent danger to
      online free speech in the EU."
