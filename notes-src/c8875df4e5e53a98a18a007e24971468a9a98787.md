    name: Do Short-Term Profits Hurt Long-Term Innovation?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Is the way companies are currently structured and operated conducive
      to long-term innovation? It's a tough question, but there are plenty of reasons
      to consider that short-term profit incentives might be getting in the way of
      better overall innovation strategies \u2014 and lots of possibilities for how
      we might rethink companies to change this. This week, the regular crew of Mike,
      Hersh and Dennis discuss how this problem could be addressed, and whether there's
      truly a problem at all."
