    author: Techdirt
    content: "We can hardly believe it, but as of this moment we've released 200 episodes
      of the Techdirt podcast! For this milestone, we've brought the increasingly-rare
      original team of co-hosts back together for a bit of a meta-episode all about
      podcasts \u2014 specifically, the recent news that Spotify has acquired Gimlet
      Media for the impressive and, to many, surprising sum of $230-million. Mike
      joined by Dennis Yang and Hersh Reddy to discuss what Spotify might be up to,
      and just how big the podcasting business really is."
