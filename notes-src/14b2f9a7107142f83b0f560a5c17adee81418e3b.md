    name: The Problems With SESTA And Why Section 230 Matters
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Recently, we've been writing about SESTA, Congress' latest attack on
      Section 230 of the CDA, and helping to organize a campaign against it. But there's
      still a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation out there regarding the bill,
      so this week we're joined by Daphne Keller from Stanford's Center For Internet
      And Society and Emma Llans\xF3 from the Center for Democracy and Technology
      to dig deeper into the problems with the bill and why protecting Section 230
      is vital."
