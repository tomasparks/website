    author: HeadGum
    content: The party deals with the aftermath of their brutal bar fight with the
      barbarians, then heads off into the swamp to save the Green Teens. Beverly tries
      to salvage the Jamboreen, Hardwon is increasingly annoyed by the antics of Scoutmaster
      Denny ("a craven man"), Moonshine falls in love with another druid, and PawPaw
      hates his leash.
