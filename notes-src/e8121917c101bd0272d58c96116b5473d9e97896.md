    name: Facebook Won't Save Democracy
    author: Techdirt
    content: In the midst of the political chaos in America and the world at large,
      a whole lot of attention has been turned to Facebook and its role in modern
      democracy. The social network has responded by announcing another round of news
      feed changes, the true impact of which (if any) remains far from clear. This
      week, we're joined by Mathew Ingram from the Columbia Journalism Review to talk
      about Facebook's changes, and whether we can or should expect them to fix anything.
