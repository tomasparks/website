    name: 'Ep 43: Professor Teresa Ghilarducci on the Future of 401(k)s'
    author: Adam Ruins Everything
    content: "As humans, our inclination is to live in the present - not save 40 years
      down the line - which makes saving money for retirement hard. In the 90s many
      companies began offering 401(k) programs, a retirement savings plan sponsored
      by an employer which lets workers save and invest a piece of their paycheck
      before taxes. It seemed like the perfect solution to our retirement woes. But
      401(k)s aren't the full proof saving plan we once thought. Even judiciously
      setting aside money in a 401(k) might not be enough to maintain one's lifestyle
      into retirement. There are also so many outside factors that can still diminish
      one's savings, including unexpected healthcare costs, recessions, or lost jobs.
      So how do we set ourselves up for a secure financial future?\r\n\r\nOur guest
      Professor Teresa Ghilarducci, who appeared on Adam Ruins the Future, is going
      to tell us how we entered into this financial mess and how we can get out of
      it. She suggests we do the best we can to save through 401(k)s, live within
      our means, start planning our financial future as young as we can, delay collecting
      social security as much as we can, and vote for representatives who can help
      reform this system. Teresa is a labor economist and nationally-recognized expert
      in retirement security. She's also a professor of economics at The New School
      for Social Research.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter @AdamConover and you can find
      past episodes and bonus content from the TruTV show at AdamRuinsEverything.com.\r\n\r\nProduced
      by Shara Morris for MaximumFun.org."
