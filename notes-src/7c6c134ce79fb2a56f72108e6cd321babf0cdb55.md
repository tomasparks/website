    name: Why People Don't Trust Capitalism Anymore
    author: Techdirt
    content: "The tides of public opinion on economics seem to be shifting, and criticism
      of the very idea of free markets is on the ride. The conversation is messy,
      confusing, and transcends many traditional political boundaries \u2014 so we've
      got an expert source to help us dig in. EconTalk host Russ Roberts joins us
      to look at why so many people don't trust capitalism anymore."
