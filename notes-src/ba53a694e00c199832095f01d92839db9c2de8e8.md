    name: The New FCC
    author: Techdirt
    content: Net neutrality is at risk. The FCC under Ajit Pai is clearly intent on
      destroying it, and this is quickly turning into a fight for the future of the
      internet. This week, we're joined by Gigi Sohn, one of former chairman Tom Wheeler
      top advisors at the FCC and now a fellow at the Open Society Foundation, to
      discuss what's happening at the FCC and what needs to be done in response.
