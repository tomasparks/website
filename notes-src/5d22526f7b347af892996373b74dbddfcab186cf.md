    author: Techdirt
    content: "After years of working on the go, Mike has the mobile office down to
      a science \u2014 and wherever he sets it up, nearby gadget geeks have plenty
      of questions and comments. So this week we're joined by Espree Devora, host
      of the podcasts Women In Tech and We Are L.A. Tech, for a fun discussion about
      today's high-tech offices-in-bags."
