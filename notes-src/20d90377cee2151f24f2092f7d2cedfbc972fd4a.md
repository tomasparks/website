    name: Free Speech, Limited?
    author: Mozilla
    content: "In our final episode of season 1, we break from our usual format to
      host a big conversation. Recent events like the Charlottesville, VA rally have
      revealed the Internet\u2019s role in helping spread IRL threats and violence.
      Leaders in the tech world have represented varying positions on both protecting
      free speech and also reducing hate speech online.  Should tech companies regulate
      who says what on the Internet? Brandi Collins of Color of Change, Anil Dash
      of Fog Creek Software and Jillian York of the Electronic Frontier Foundation
      address this question and more with Veronica Belmont.\n"
