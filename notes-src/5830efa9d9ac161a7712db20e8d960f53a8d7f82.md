    name: The Sorting Episode
    author: Jason Scott
    content: 'The Sorting Episode: A Life of Sorting, File Classifications, My Subdirectories,
      The Storage Unit, Photos and Movies and Boxes and Personal, The Actual Question,
      What the Actual Answer Might Be, An Empty Container. Plus: An Offer to Help
      Me Sort. A lot of people asked me to speak about my sorting method - I hope
      it''s simple and straightforward how I approach things. I use this everywhere,
      and if I wanted to be a very bearded Marie Kondo, this is how I''d start to
      explain myself. Like all the other times I invite people into projects, the
      project mentioned at the end is going to be continual and the offer won''t expire.
      Thanks for considering some help.'
