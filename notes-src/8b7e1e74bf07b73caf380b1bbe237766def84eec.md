    name: Tech Policy Goes Local
    author: Techdirt
    content: "The conversation around tech policy has traditionally happened at the
      federal level, but more recently we've seen a change in that trend, and some
      of the most interesting experiments \u2014 both good and bad \u2014 have started
      happening in state and municipal arenas. This week, we're joined by Tech:NYC
      Executive Director Julie Samuels to discuss why this is happening and what it
      means."
