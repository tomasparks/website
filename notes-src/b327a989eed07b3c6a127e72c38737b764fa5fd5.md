    name: Face Value
    author: Mozilla
    content: "From Snapchat filters to Google\u2019s art selfies, biometric technology
      plays a growing role in our everyday lives. What do we actually give up when
      we upload our face to these apps? Steven Talley shares his experience as the
      victim of mistaken identity. Artist Adam Harvey investigates how racial bias
      seeps into big data sets. Emily Kennedy and Glynnis MacNicol talk about the
      power and risks of recognition for marginalized communities. Joseph Atick, a
      forefather of facial recognition technology, reckons with its future. And we
      head to China, where you\u2019ll need your face to use the bathroom.\n"
