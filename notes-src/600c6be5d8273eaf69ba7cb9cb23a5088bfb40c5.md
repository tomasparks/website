    name: Free Speech Disorder, With Mike Godwin
    author: Techdirt
    content: Last week, we published a series of posts by Mike Godwin looking at Our
      Bipolar Free Speech Disorder And How To Fix It (check out part one, part two,
      and part three). But with a topic like this, there's always more to dig into,
      so this week we've got Mike Godwin joining the podcast to take a closer look
      at his ideas about free speech in the digital era.
