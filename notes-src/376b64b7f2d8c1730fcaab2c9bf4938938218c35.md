    name: A Presidential Tech Policy Wish List
    author: Techdirt
    content: We wanted to do an episode all about examining the tech policy platforms
      of the 2016 presidential candidates, but that proved impossible since one candidate's
      is vague and noncommittal while the other's doesn't exist at all. Since a nuanced
      discussion about robust tech policy platforms was probably a bit much to hope
      for from this election anyway, for this week's episode we're discussing what
      a great presidential tech platform should look like under less absurd circumstances.
