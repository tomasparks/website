    name: The Song of the Information Cube
    author: Jason Scott
    content: "The Song of the Information Cube: The Piles, The Shelves, The Ark, The
      Visitors, The Moment of Realization, The Burden, The Exodus, The Freedom. Also:
      The Bill. The Legend of the Information Cube! And with it, ten episodes of the
      podcast recorded. As someone who has done a lot of archiving of podcasts over
      the years, I know this is the critical jump - it's when a lot of these either
      strengthen their resolve and last a long time, or when they just fade away.\_
      I'm intending to stick around.\_"
