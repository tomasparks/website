    name: The Failure Of High Tech Policing
    author: Techdirt
    content: 'Sometimes people ask us why we write so much about the police on Techdirt.
      Though our coverage has grown somewhat beyond the boundaries of incidents directly
      involving technology, the reality is that the problems with law enforcement
      persistently intersect with the same technological and legal issues we''ve always
      discussed here. But this week the focus is squarely on cops and technology:
      Mike is joined by Matt Stroud, author of the new book Thin Blue Lie, as well
      as our own Tim Cushing, to talk about the failure of high-tech policing.'
