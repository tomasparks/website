    name: The User Meets Episode
    author: Jason Scott
    content: 'User Meets, Online Versus Offline, OSUNY, Without a Location, 2600 Meetings,
      The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, The Works, Trials, What Are You Doing
      I loosened up my speaking style a tad to see how that flows. A lot of fun thoughts
      and stories about user meets, BBS meets and life offline versus online. This
      episode mentions the new funding goal, where I''ll add link dumps to each episode''s
      description. Thanks again! '
