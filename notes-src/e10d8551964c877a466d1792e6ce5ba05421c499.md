    name: Is There Enough Demand For The On Demand Economy?
    author: Techdirt
    content: The "gig economy" of on-demand peer-to-peer services like Uber has been
      gaining traction, but not every company is faring so well. In some areas, the
      rush of entrants has outstripped demand and left on-demand providers struggling
      to stay afloat. This week we discuss what happens when there's not enough demand
      for an on-demand platform, and what it might mean for the sector as a whole.
