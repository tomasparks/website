    name: Senator Wyden On The Expansion Of FBI Surveillance
    author: Techdirt
    content: It should surprise nobody that the FBI is seeking even broader digital
      surveillance powers by changing the warrant requirements and expanding the power
      of national security letters. If you're a regular Techdirt reader, it also won't
      surprise you to learn that Senator Ron Wyden is working hard to hold the line
      against this kind of expansion. This week, we're joined by Senator Wyden to
      discuss what the FBI is up to and what the public needs to know about it.
