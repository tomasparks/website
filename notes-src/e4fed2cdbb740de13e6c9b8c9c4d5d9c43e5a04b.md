    name: Have Platforms Killed The Open Internet By Replacing Protocols?
    author: Techdirt
    content: 'The internet is built on a solid foundation of open protocols: TCP/IP,
      HTTP and SMTP especially, plus more modern entrants like RSS and BitTorrent.
      But even those aren''t so new anymore, and it seems like the era of the open
      protocol might be coming to an end, supplanted by the drive to create proprietary
      closed platforms. This week, we discuss whether the open protocol is dead, and
      what that means for the future of the open internet.'
