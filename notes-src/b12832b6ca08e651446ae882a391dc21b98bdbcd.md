    name: 168. The History of Java With Todd Sundsted
    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: "People have been yelling at me for years that I\u2019ve not covered
      more technical aspects of the web\u2019s history, especially things like Java.
      Specifically Java. The argument can be made that Java helped the web evolve
      into what it\u2019s become. So, that\u2019s why I was thrilled to sit down with
      Todd Sundsted, who is a developer who has been working with Java for more than
      20 years. Todd walks us through the history of Java and why it is so important
      to the web\u2019s general evolution."
