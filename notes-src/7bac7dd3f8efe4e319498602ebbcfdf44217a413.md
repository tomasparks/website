    name: How the Nobel Prize medals were hidden from the Nazis
    author: ABC Radio National
    content: "The gold in a Nobel Prize medal is dense enough to make a big impression

      to being dissolved\u2014but that didn't stop one chemist who needed to hide
      two medals from the Nazis, as Dr Karl Kruszelnicki explains."
