    author: internethistorypodcast@gmail.com (Brian McCullough @brianmcc)
    content: "Today, we're going to continue our occasional project of getting oral
      histories and personal anecdotes about how, exactly, the Internet and the web
      came to various places around the world. On this episode we're going to look
      at how the Internet came to\u2014and is still in the process of coming to\u2014Pakistan.
      Imran Haider is a listener to the show, works in the tech industry, and analyzes
      the south asian tech scene at his blog, arkito.co. Today, he tells us how the
      digital revolution came to Pakistan, how it's still in the process of rolling
      out, what that has meant for Pakistani society and what the startup and tech
      scene IS in Pakistan. My thanks to Imran Haider for being a longtime listener
      to this show, and for being willing to contribute to the project, and please,
      check him out at arkito.co--- it's Ben Thompson level analysis of the tech scene
      in the sub continent.\r\n      "
