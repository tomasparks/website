    content: 'The Doomed Infocom Dinner Episode: The Eye-Opening E-mail, An Infocom
      Life, After Infocom Infocom, Phoning in a Text Adventure, Thaumistry, Spellcasting
      101, Uncreated Games, The Miracle of Game Engines. Plus: Emergency Room. There
      are three podcasts being posted today. I''m keeping to 4 a month and I just
      got hit with a lot of commitments and project work that took me away from recording.
      I also recorded an episode while I was in California that had sound so terrible
      I just had to try again.  This one''s about one of my favorite letters I ever
      got, as well as thoughts on creating games then and now, and the benefits of
      each. I love creative tools so much!'
