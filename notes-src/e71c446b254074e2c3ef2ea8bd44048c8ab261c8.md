    name: 186. TheGlobe.com Story with Stephan Paternot
    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: "I said in the book, I think TheGlobe.com was the quintessential dot-com
      company. We spoke to one of the cofounders previously, Todd Krizelman. Todd
      was great, but he was time constrained and he didn\u2019t quite get as personal
      about the story as I would have hoped. Well, I finally got to talk to the other
      founder of TheGlobe, Stephan Paternot. And Stephan was\u2026 AMAZING. He shared
      the whole story, the whole wild ride, from a historical angle, from a business
      angle, from an entrepreneurial angle and also, from a very personal angle. THIS
      the dot-com era story I\u2019ve been looking for for years. It\u2019s also the
      story of probably the most important pioneer of social media before there was
      even a term for such a thing. And by the way\u2026 that TV Show that just came
      out on NAT GEO, Valley of the Boom? THIS IS THAT STORY. Stephan just re-released
      his book, A Very Public Offering: The Story of theglobe.com and the First Internet
      Revolution."
