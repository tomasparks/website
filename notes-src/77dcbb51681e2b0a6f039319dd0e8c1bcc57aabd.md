    author: Gimlet
    content: "This week we enter the mysterious, Byzantine underworld of domain sales,
      where people make money speculating on the website naming market. A few years
      ago, the owners of the popular journalism website longform.org blundered into

      we find out about their misadventures, and we hear from the Derek Jeter of URL
      purchases.\r\n      "
