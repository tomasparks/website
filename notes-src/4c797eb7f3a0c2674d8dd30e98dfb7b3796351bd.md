    content: "This week, Jean talks to Eddie Hinkle. He\u2019s a software engineer
      who lives in the Washington DC area, and he is working on several interesting
      projects, including Indigenous, an iOS app that provides an interface for the
      IndieWeb. Jean was grateful that Eddie could make the time to chat, especially
      as he is also a father-to-be whose child is due this week!\r\n\r\nhttp://monday.micro.blog/2018/07/16/eddiehinkle.html"
