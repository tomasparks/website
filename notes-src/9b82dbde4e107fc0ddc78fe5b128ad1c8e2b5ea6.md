    name: Overreacting To Facebook's Mistakes Won't Solve Anything
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Facebook. Cambridge Analytica. Need I say more? There's plenty to discuss.
      Among them is the question of similarities between what happened and the Obama
      campaign \u2014 which is why we're lucky to be joined this week by Catherine
      Bracy, who led the Obama campaign's San Francisco tech office, and worked on
      its Facebook app, for a discussion about what really went down with Cambridge
      Analytica, and all the misinformation that's out there."
