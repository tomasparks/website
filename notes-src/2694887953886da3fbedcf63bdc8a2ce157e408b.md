    name: Can Tech Be Trusted Without Antitrust?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Monopolies are one of the areas that even the most staunchly anti-regulation
      folks often agree there is a role for government intervention. In the world
      of tech, multiple big antitrust fights have broken out and continue to rage
      in both America and the EU \u2014 but how effective is this kind of regulation
      and how often should it really happen? This week, we discuss whether or not
      there is a role for antitrust in the world of technological innovation."
