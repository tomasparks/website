    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: "Karel Baloun was the first senior software engineer hired at Facebook
      in 2005. Baloun was only at Facebook for a year, from 2005 to 2006, but he provides
      some amazing insights about the company. What was Facebook\u2019s culture like
      in 2005? What were the key innovations that ultimately let Facebook succeed
      where others failed? Would Zuckerberg make a good President of the United States?
      What became of Pokey, the mascot Facebook once considered launching?"
