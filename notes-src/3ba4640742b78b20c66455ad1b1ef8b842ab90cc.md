    name: When A Typo Breaks The Internet
    author: Techdirt
    content: "From its humble origins as an online bookseller that many people worried
      might not survive, Amazon has grown into a critical piece of the web's backbone
      via its Amazon Web Services platform. Last week's S3 outage made this painfully
      clear, and understandably raised lots of concerns \u2014 especially after it
      was revealed that the whole thing was caused by a typo. So this week we're discussing
      whether something needs to be done, and what that might be."
