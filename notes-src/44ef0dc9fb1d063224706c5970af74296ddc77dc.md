    author: Techdirt
    content: "We've been covering surveillance and the intelligence community for
      a long time here at Techdirt, but if you had to limit yourself to just one source
      on the subject, even we'd probably recommend you choose Marcy Wheeler. Following
      the recent news that the NSA has apparently shut down its bulk records collection
      program \u2014 the first exposed by Edward Snowden \u2014 Marcy joins us on
      this week's episode to discuss the surveillance state and why it might abandon
      Section 215."
