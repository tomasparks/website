    name: "Pok\xE9mon Gone?"
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Just over a year ago, when Pok\xE9mon Go was taking the world by storm,
      we dedicated an episode of the podcast to discussing what made it so successful,
      and ended up with some differing predictions about what its future would be.
      Now, with the hype long and truly over but the game still far from dead (though
      just how far is up for debate), it's time to revisit the subject and figure
      out who, if anyone, was right about the future of Pok\xE9mon Go.\r\n\r\nHear
      the original episode: https://soundcloud.com/techdirt/is-it-the-pokemon-or-the-go-that-matters"
