    name: Anonymity In The Media & Online
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Anonymity is back in the news in a big way, especially since the New
      York Times published an explosive opinion piece by an anonymous White House
      official. Here at Techdirt \u2014 proudly one of the few blogs that still allows
      completely anonymous comments with no sign-up \u2014 we've talked about anonymity
      for a long time in the context of the internet. On this week's episode, Mike
      and regular co-hosts Dennis Yang and Hersh Reddy talk about the benefits, challenges,
      and overall importance of anonymous speech."
