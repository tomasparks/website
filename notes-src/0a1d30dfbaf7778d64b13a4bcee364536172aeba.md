    name: Is It Futile To Draw Borders On The Internet?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "In a world defined by borders for thousands of years, the global nature
      of the internet has caused all sorts of confusion and absurdity. Geographically
      restricted content, fuzzily defined jurisdictions, libel tourism \u2014 these
      are all symptoms of a border-filled world coming to terms with a borderless
      network. Since attempts to carve up the internet along geographical lines aren't
      likely to stop anytime soon, this week we ask the question: are such attempts
      futile, and could online borders really serve any purpose to begin with?"
