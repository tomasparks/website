    content: "The Kansasfest Episode: Why I Love Kansasfest, The Apple II, Living
      There, The Events and the Magic, The Friendship, The Purpose of a Vacation,
      The Best Things, Race You. Plus: Emergency Room.\r\nI have two episodes about
      Apple II subjects and then I think it's best to lay off the Apple II for a while.
      I do so many other things and have so much more to talk about! I also mention
      a visit to the Emergency Room, and this Patreon made it a cakewalk. Thanks again."
