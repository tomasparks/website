    name: An Interview With Rep Zoe Lofgren
    author: Techdirt
    content: 'When it comes to many of the legislative issues of interest to us here
      at Techdirt, we''ve always been able to count on at least one voice of reason
      amidst the congressional chaos: Representative Zoe Lofgren from California.
      In addition to playing a critical role in the fight against SOPA, she continues
      to be a voice of reason against bad copyright policy, expansive government surveillance,
      and the broken CFAA, among many other things. This week, she joins Mike on the
      podcast for a wide-ranging discussion about these topics and more.'
