    name: Is air conditioning sexist?
    author: ABC Radio National
    content: For 50 years air conditioning in commercial buildings has been set using
      the Standard 55 guidelines. But many workplaces aren't staffed solely with 40-year-old
      men dressed in 60s business suits, and that's left women out in the cold, as
      Dr Karl Kruszelnicki argues.
