    name: MEP Julia Reda On EU's Dangerous Copyright Proposal
    author: Techdirt
    content: As we've noted recently, the current copyright reform proposal being
      considered by the EU is full of extremely dangerous ideas, from mandated filters
      to a "link tax". This week, we're joined by European Parliament member Julia
      Reda to talk about the details of the regulatory process and the problems with
      the current proposal.
