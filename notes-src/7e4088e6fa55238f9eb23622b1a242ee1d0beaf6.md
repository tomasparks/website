    name: The Lost Art Of Productive Debate
    author: Techdirt
    content: Even those of us who believe that the internet is overall a tremendous
      positive force when it comes to discourse and culture can admit that, in many
      parts of the online world, having constructive and substantive conversations
      is--- difficult. And that issue has most certainly come to the fore in the last
      couple of years. So this week, we're joined by author Barry Eisler (one of our
      first and most frequent podcast guests) to tackle the challenge of framing important
      debates in productive ways, and actually getting somewhere with them.
