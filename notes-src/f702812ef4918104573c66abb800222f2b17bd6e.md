    content: "Claude Shannon was a mathematician, electrical engineer, and cryptographer
      known as \"the father of information theory.\" In the pantheon of cool people
      who made the modern information era possible, he\u2019s right up there. Today,
      we\u2019re going to talk to the authors of a great biography of the man called
      A Mind At Play, How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age. Especially
      you software engineers out there, if you don\u2019t know who Claude Shannon
      was, get educated. You owe your livelihood to this man."
