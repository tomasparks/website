    name: Changing Government Starts With You
    author: Techdirt
    content: For obvious reasons, politics and government are on just about everyone's
      mind at the moment, prompting a vast range of reactions and opinions. A lot
      of people who share a desire for change are divided not only by what form they
      think that change should take, but by what methods they think should be employed
      to achieve it. Former Senate staffer and long-time Techdirt friend Jennifer
      Hoelzer recently wrote a column entitled Your Government Won't Change--- Unless
      You Do and this week she joins us on the podcast to delve further into this
      idea and what it means for optimists, cynics, pragmatists and everyone else.
