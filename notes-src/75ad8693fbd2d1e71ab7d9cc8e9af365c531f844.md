    content: "Episode #200d - 2014 In The Mix\r\nFive years ago we crossed our fingers
      that we would go on for another hundred episodes - very few podcasts manage
      to go that long week after week, let alone with this amount of versatility and
      fun we're having with it. But we did, and we couldn't be happier about it, and
      we thank you for your continued support which keeps us going! Here's us hoping
      for 300 in 2020?\r\n\r\nToday's release contains:\r\n- 3 mixes including the
      finest demo and compo tracks from 2014\r\n- 1 bonus mix of the best demo tracks
      from 2009\r\n\r\nThis is episode #200d - Best Demotracks from 2014\r\n\r\nBitJam
      Podcast - We Are Unstoppable!\r\n\r\nMixed and compiled by Salinga, logo #200
      by KF, text by Gargaj\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nALiEN, Bobic, CONS, Cristian, Jegougou,
      KF, Salinga, Vincenzo"
