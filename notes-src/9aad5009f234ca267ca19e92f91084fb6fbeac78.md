    content: "From the push to build a border wall to the recent executive order temporarily
      banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, there are so many emotions
      associated with the current immigration policy proposals. But what are the real
      facts regarding immigration history in this country? And what are immigrants'
      \_actual impacts on our society? Today we try to answer those questions with
      our guest Professor .  Doug is a  Sociology Professor who appeared on  His research
      focuses on international migration, race and housing, discrimination, education,
      urban poverty, and Latin America, especially Mexico. On the episode, Doug and
      Adam discuss the  net migration flow of immigrants coming into United States
      from Mexico, the United States' reliance on migrant labor, and what reasonable
      immigration policy looks like."
