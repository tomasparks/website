    name: Talking Freedom Of Information With A "FOIA Terrorist"
    author: Techdirt
    content: "We've made FOIA requests several times over the years, with varying
      results \u2014 but there are others out there who have dedicated their careers
      to understanding and using the FOIA process. One such person is Jason Leopold,
      a Buzzfeed reporter and FOIA litigator who was dubbed a \"FOIA terrorist\" by
      the government. He joins us this week on the podcast to discuss the ins and
      outs of Freedom Of Information."
