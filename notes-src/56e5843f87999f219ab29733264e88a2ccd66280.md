    name: The Public Speaking Episode
    author: Jason Scott
    content: 'Public Speaking: The Iron Sheik, No Stage Fright, A Rat for Office,
      Presentations, Tips for Talks, TED is Fake, In Your Head Lover, A Five Minute
      Offer Heavily going into my thoughts on public speaking so this episode is longer
      than usual. I''ve talked about presentations and why I think they''re important
      here and there, but I try to lay it all down here, give you some pointers and
      thoughts, and hopefully inspire you to make your own. And I give an offer at
      the end. I''m always experimenting, so the podcast is not nailed down into a
      specific processed style that would come from a team working on it - so this
      episode is very dynamic and energetic. Learning my limits and what works and
      doesn''t is always important, as well as your feedback.'
