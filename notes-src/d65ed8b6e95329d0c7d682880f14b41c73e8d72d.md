    name: The Grand Bargain
    author: Mozilla
    content: "We\u2019re told from a young age to \u201Caccept the things we cannot
      change.\u201D But should this be the case online as well? We click \u201CAccept\u201D
      every day, but often don\u2019t know what we\u2019re giving away. Is it a fair
      trade, and should we demand a better bargain? Veronica Belmont and special guest
      Dave Pell explore if what we get for what we give online is a good deal. We
      hear how one man\u2019s HIV status was exposed without permission, how a massive
      data-mining company is using our information to predict how we'll behave, and
      why on earth our email inboxes are filling up with privacy policies.\n"
