    content: "The River Kingdoms are a constantly shifting group of city-states, kingdoms,
      and fiefdoms, rising and falling through the machinations of would-be conquerors,
      wars, assassinations, games of politics, and dangerous monsters. South of Brevoy
      sit the Stolen Lands \u2013 stolen from what and when are a matter of debate
      \u2013 currently overrun by bandits and monsters. [\u2026]"
