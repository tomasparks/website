    author: The Planetary Society
    content: "The New Horizons mission was a triumph, revealing Pluto as an utterly
      unique and beautiful world. But the mission first had to survive challenge after
      challenge, fighting to be developed, meeting a nearly impossible launch deadline,
      and then narrowly avoiding disaster when it was barely a week from its destination.
      The entire dramatic tale has now been told by Principal Investigator Alan Stern
      and his co-author, astrobiologist David Grinspoon.&nbsp; They join Mat Kaplan
      to talk about their book, Chasing New Horizons\u2014Inside the Epic First Mission
      to Pluto.&nbsp; A signed copy of the book will go to the winner of this episode\u2019s
      space trivia contest.&nbsp; Emily Lakdawalla has returned from an international
      gathering of Mercury scientists with a special report.&nbsp; The Planetary Society\u2019s
