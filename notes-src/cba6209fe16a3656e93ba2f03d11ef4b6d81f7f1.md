    name: Life Without The Tech Giants
    author: Techdirt
    content: 'One of the most common responses to various complaints about giant tech
      companies is that you can just not use their products and services. Many people
      have pointed out just how difficult that would really be, but Gizmodo''s Kashmir
      Hill decided to try it for real: she cut Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft,
      and Apple out of her life for a week each, followed by a week without any of
      them. Her report on that final, empty week is coming out soon, but in the mean
      time she joins us on the podcast to talk about what it''s like to live without
      big tech.'
