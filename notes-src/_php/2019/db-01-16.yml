      name: The EU Endangers Free Speech Online... Again
      author: Techdirt
      content: "The latest in the EU's string of internet regulatory efforts has a
        new target: terrorist propaganda. Just as with past regulations, the proposed
        rules seem onerous and insane, creating huge liability for internet platforms
        that fail to do the impossible. This week, we're joined by returning guests
        Daphne Keller from Stanford's Center For Internet And Society and Emma Llans\xF3
        from the Center for Democracy and Technology to discuss this most recent danger
        to online free speech in the EU."
