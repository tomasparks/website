      content: In the latest episode of An Indieweb Podcast, Chris Aldrich joined
        me for a late night(for me at least) discussion of Gutenberg, the new WordPress
        editor, and the usual project talk. I felt I was a bit off due the lateness
        of the hour, but I still enjoyed the conversation.
