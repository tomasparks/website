    name: The Surveillance State
    author: Techdirt
    content: "In the post-Snowden era, we don't have to tell you how important it
      is to stay engaged with (and vigilant about) the surveillance state in America.
      Jennifer Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for
      Internet and Society, and author of the new book American Spies \u2014 and this
      week she joins us for an in-depth discussion about the surveillance state today.
      Of course, shortly after we recorded this podcast, the NSA made major changes
      to one of its surveillance programs, so Jennifer returned to record an addendum
      examining this latest news, so make sure you listen to the end!"
