    name: Apple, The FBI & You
    author: Techdirt
    content: I don't think I need to reiterate how important the battle over the future
      of encryption is. It's not new, but rather the latest clash in a fight that
      has been raging for years, and the high-profile example of the San Bernardino
      attacker's iPhone has cast a spotlight on it. This week, we're joined by longtime
      Techdirt friend Marvin Ammori to dig into the details of this issue, its potential
      consequences, and its context in the history of encryption.
