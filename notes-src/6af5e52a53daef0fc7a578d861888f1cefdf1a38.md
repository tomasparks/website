    name: 'The Great Encryption Debate: Should There Be Back Doors?'
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Anyone who reads Techdirt knows our opinion on encryption: stronger
      is better, and giving the government (or anyone else) a back door is a dangerous
      idea. We've decried a lot of the stupid arguments that we've heard in favor
      of back doors \u2014 usually coming from technologically clueless politicians
      and law enforcement officers \u2014 but that doesn't mean we aren't open to
      considering some smart ones. This week, we've invited Albert Wenger (who you
      may recall from a discussion about basic income way back in Episode 16) to share
      his pro-backdoor position and engage in some friendly debate."
