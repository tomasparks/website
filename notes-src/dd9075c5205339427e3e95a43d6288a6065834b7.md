    name: 'Ep 42: Professor Ellen Dunham-Jones on Retrofitting Suburbia'
    author: Adam Ruins Everything
    content: "While they may sport perfectly manicured lawns and beautiful white picket
      fences, suburbs are not the idyllic neighborhoods we think they are. They make
      us more sedentary, sometimes less safe, and they can even perpetuate segregation.
      But instead of leaving the suburbs we can actually address these issues and
      improve our suburbs through redevelopment and retrofitting neighborhoods to
      make them greener, healthier, safer and more affordable. Our guest Ellen Dunham-Jones,
      who appeared on Adam Ruins the Suburbs, tells us all about it. She has spent
      her career studying how suburbs can adapt to these 21st century challenges.
      Ellen is a leading authority on suburban redevelopment and is the Professor
      of Architecture and Urban Design at Georgia Tech.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter
      @AdamConover and you can find past episodes and bonus content from the TruTV
      show at AdamRuinsEverything.com.\r\n\r\nProduced by Shara Morris for MaximumFun.org."
