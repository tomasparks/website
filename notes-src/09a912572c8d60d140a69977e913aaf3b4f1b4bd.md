    name: 189. A Legal History of the Web Era With Richard Chapo
    author: Brian McCullough
    content: "It\u2019s bothered me for a while that over the 5 years or so of this
      podcast, we haven\u2019t focused very much on some corners of the history. For
      example\u2026 the legal side? Copyright law? Intellectual property law? How
      much have we talked about disruption and piracy and filesharing and all that
      stuff? So, I spoke to Richard Chapo, who has been doing Internet Law since the
      web went mainstream. We talk about the Napster era, we talk about how much of
      an influence the adult industry had on digital law, we talk about the state
      of digital law today, and actually, a whole bunch of contemtorary law stuff
      like GDPR."
