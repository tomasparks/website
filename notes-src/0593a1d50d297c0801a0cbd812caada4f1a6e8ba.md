    name: The Truth About VPNs
    author: Techdirt
    content: "For a long time now, \"use a VPN\" has been the default online privacy
      advice \u2014 but is it really so effective? Following the recent VPN boom that
      came on the tails of Congress scrapping new ISP privacy rules, a few security
      experts have stepped forward to explain how VPNs aren't all they're cracked
      up to be, and choosing and using one isn't as easy as many articles and social
      media posts suggest. Among them are this week's guests, Kevin Riggle (who provided
      a quick and dirty primer with the key suggestion that most people are safer
      not using a VPN) and Kenn White (who assembled a list of VPNs he deems \"terrible\"
      and not without good reason, recommending a roll-your-own solution instead).
      They join us to dig deeper into the reality of VPNs and hopefully help some
      people make better choices."
