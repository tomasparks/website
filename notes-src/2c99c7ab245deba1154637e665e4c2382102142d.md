    name: 'Episode 19: Jet'
    author: Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal
    content: "Ben & David break down Jet.com\u2019s meteoric rise, culminating in
      Walmart\u2019s blockbuster $3B+ acquisition of the company just two years after
      its founding. Will we look back on this deal as an \u2018Instagram-like\u2019
      bargain or a \u2018Pets.com'-sized blunder? And most importantly, can *anyone*
      compete with Amazon going forward? We speculate wildly.  Topics covered include:
      \ - Community spotlight: Nowdue, a super fast invoicing platform for teams on
      Slack. Invoice like it\u2019s the future! This looks very cool. - Jet\u2019s
      deep origins in Founder & CEO Marc Lore\u2019s first two companies, The Pit
      and Quidsi (aka, diapers.com) - Lore\u2019s chance run-in with Jeff Bezos at
      a school picnic in Seattle in the early 2000\u2019s - Amazon's dramatic acquisition
      of Quidsi in 2010, including Bezos\u2019 admonition to Amazon corp dev to keep
      Quidsi from being bought by Walmart under any circumstances (covered well in
      The Everything Store) - Lore\u2019s less-than-favorable opinion of Amazon's
      culture - Lore's vision of Jet as an \u2018online Costco\u2019 that can directly
      with Amazon on price by selling goods to a \u201Chuge middle-class of people\"
      at effectively zero margin, and make profit on membership fees - Jet\u2019s
      huge, pre-launch fundraising rounds, and subsequent massively promoted public
      launch in July 2015 - Jet\u2019s pivot in October 2015 to drop the membership
      model (their only profit engine), and subsequent massive growth (but also accompanying
      massive losses) - 'Admitting defeat\u201D to Amazon in July 2016? Immediately
      followed by the blockbuster $3B+ Walmart acquisition announcement - Is e-commerce
      really a winner-take-all business and will Amazon just take over the world?
      Featuring liberal citations (again) of Ben Thompson's Aggregation Theory and
      the importance of customer experience. - Is there any path for Walmart & Jet
      to compete effectively with Amazon? Is Marc Lore Walmart\u2019s only hope? -
      Fantastic interview with Tim Cook discussing (among other things) the massive
      amount of growth still left in the internet  Followups:  - Lucasfilm: Star Wars
      Rouge One trailer drops! Featuring a strong female protagonist!  New section:
      Hot Takes! (thank you @cteitzel on Slack for the idea)  - Verizon/AOL acquires
      Yahoo! - Lyft reportedly turns down acquisition offer from GM - Microsoft acquires
      Beam - Randstad acquires Monster.com  The Carve Out  - Ben: Michael Mauboussin\u2019s
      Talk at Google and Reflections on the Ten Attributes of Great Investors after
      thirty years of honing his craft - David: Strava, the fantastic social fitness-tracking
      app"
