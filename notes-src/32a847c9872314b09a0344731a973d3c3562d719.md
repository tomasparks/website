    name: Electric motors in bacteria (part 2)
    author: ABC Radio National
    content: "Dr Karl Kruszelnicki\_is fascinated by how bacteria rotate their\_flagellum
      counter-clockwise, much like a manmade electric motor. But unlike the motors
      that humans make, this dynamic microscopic molecular machine is constantly being
      rebuilt and reconfigured on the run."
