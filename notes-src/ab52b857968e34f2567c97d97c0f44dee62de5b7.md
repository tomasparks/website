    content: "President Trump just signed a new space policy directive targeting the
      regulations surrounding commercial spaceflight. Casey Dreier, Jason Davis and
      Mat Kaplan dive into the implications of the new directive and what it means
      for the relationship between government and space. They also break down all
      of the good news in the House's new funding bill for NASA, and highlight NASA
      Administrator Jim Bridenstine's turnaround on climate change. More resources
      to explore this month\u2019s topics are at &nbsp;http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/planetary-radio/show/2018/space-policy-edition-26.html\n
