    name: "Season 2, Episode 4:\_SoftBank, Fortress and the Vision Fund"
    author: Ben Gilbert & David Rosenthal
    content: "Acquired dives into the topic on the minds and lips of just about every
      VC and founder these days: SoftBank\u2019s $93B+ Vision Fund, and its seemingly-overnight
      rewriting of the rules of venture capital and startup fundraising. Where did
      this new 800lbs gorilla come from, what are its goals, and what does it mean
      for the future of silicon valley and the global tech ecosystem? The answer,
      it turns out, starts with an acquisition, and unfolds into a story no one has
      yet told and few yet understand. Luckily our heroes are on the case!"
