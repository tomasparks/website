    name: Andy
    author: Jason Scott
    content: Andy. With the close of the year comes the exciting prospect of how next
      year's taxes will be handled. Naturally, I'll be having an accountant help me.
      I bring this up as I have multiple times in the past because I've run into a
      number of people who have tax issues who are some sort of ashamed that they're
      experiencing problems or bumps, and feel in some way this makes them look bad.
      If I may, please let me be the first to say that taxes are not intuitive and
      you can't just wing them or think it's something you might get perfectly right
      going it alone. This is doubly the case now that the tax laws are changing.
      Don't avoid dealing with them, like I did. Next up for me regarding this podcast
      will be refining delivery and process. It's fun to learn on the way.
