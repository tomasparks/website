      lives online. Join Veronica Belmont and Manoush Zomorodi as they explore what
      kids are facing on the interwebs, how they\u2019re using social media for good,
      how they\u2019re handling cyberbullying, and how parents can keep up.\n\nParkland,
      Florida\u2019s Cameron Kasky discusses how he uses social media as a platform
      for activism; tech journalist Alexandra Samuel talks about Lil Tay and  the
      role parents can play as they help their children navigate the internet; and
