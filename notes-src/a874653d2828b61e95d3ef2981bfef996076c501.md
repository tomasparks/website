    name: Where Do You Get Your News?
    author: Techdirt
    content: The news industry has been in an ongoing state of upheaval ever since
      the dawn of the internet. In addition to the many ways that technology changes
      reporting and publishing, there has also been a profound effect on how people
      find their news. This week, we step away from the big debate about echo chambers
      and filter bubbles, and talk about evolving news-finding habits and what they
      mean for the industry.
