    name: Tom Wheeler Reacts To Trump's FCC
    author: Techdirt
    content: "If you're a Techdirt reader or just a general regular on the ol' internet,
      our topic this week \u2014 the current situation with net neutrality and the
      FCC \u2014 needs little introduction. And we've got two very special guests
      joining us to discuss it: former FCC Chair Tom Wheeler (author of the rules
      that Ajit Pai is currently undoing) and his former advisor Gigi Sohn (who joined
      us on the podcast in February to predict pretty much exactly what is now happening).
      There are few people as qualified to talk about these issues, so enjoy this
      week's episode looking at Trump's FCC and the future of the internet as we know
      it."
