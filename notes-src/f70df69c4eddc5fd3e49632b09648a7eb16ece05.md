    name: Inside A Really Good Kickstarter Campaign
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Not all Kickstarter campaigns are created equal. Even the mostly-good
      ones that eventually satisfy their backers are often plagued with delays and
      poor communication. But once in a while, there's a campaign that runs smoothly,
      communicates openly, and delivers a great product on time as promised \u2014
      and Minaal is one company that pulled off such a campaign to launch its line
      of travel bags. This week, we're joined by co-founder Jimmy Hayes to discuss
      how they pulled it off and what their experience can teach us about other campaigns
      and the broader crowdfunding ecosystem."
