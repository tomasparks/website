    name: 150. More SoundCloud Chat with Buzzfeed's Ryan Mac
    author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
    content: "Just as last week\u2019s episode posted, another great piece about SoundCloud
      was posted on Buzzfeed by the great Ryan Mac. So, in a rare attempt by me to
      be topical, today\u2019s episode is with Ryan Mac, discussing his article, which
      fills in some of the details about what Christina and I were speculating on
      last week."
