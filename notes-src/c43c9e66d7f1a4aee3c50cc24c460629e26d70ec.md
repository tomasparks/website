    name: What Does It Mean For Social Media To Be Held Accountable?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "This isn't the first time we've discussed this on the podcast, and it
      probably won't be the last \u2014 disinformation online is a big and complicated
      topic, and there are a whole lot of angles to approach it from. This week, we're
      joined by Renee DiResta, who has been researching disinformation ever since
      the anti-vaxxer movement caught her attention, to discuss what exactly it means
      to say social media platforms should be held accountable."
