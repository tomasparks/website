    name: Old Tweets & Your Permanent Record
    author: Techdirt
    content: There has long been anxiety around the "permanent record" of the internet,
      and recent public shamings based on old tweets have brought that fear to the
      forefront for many people. But the mass deletion of old tweets also means throwing
      out huge amounts of potentially valuable information. Is there a technological
      solution? A cultural one? This week, we're joined by returning guests Cathy
      Gellis and Parker Higgins to discuss a proposal for fixing the problem without
      sacrificing the permanent record.
