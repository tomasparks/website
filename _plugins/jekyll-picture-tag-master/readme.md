# Jekyll Picture Tag

**Easy responsive images for Jekyll.**

Jekyll Picture Tag is a liquid tag that adds responsive images to your [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) static site. It follows the [picture element](http://picture.responsiveimages.org/) pattern, and polyfills older browsers with [Picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill). Jekyll Picture Tag automatically creates resized source images, is fully configurable, and covers all use cases — including art direction and resolution switching — with a little YAML configuration and a simple template tag.

For non-responsive images in Jekyll, take a look at [Jekyll Img Tag](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/jekyll-img-tag).

## Why use Jekyll Picture Tag?

**Performance:** Static sites can be can be blazingly fast. If we're not using responsive images we're throwing those performance gains away by serving kilobytes of pixels a user will never see.

**Proof:** The picture element covers more responsive image use cases than any other proposed solution. As a result, the markup is more verbose. This plugin shows that in practice picture can be easy for website authors to use and maintain.

For an introduction to the picture element and responsive images in general see [Mo’ Pixels Mo’ Problems](http://alistapart.com/article/mo-pixels-mo-problems) and the follow up article [Ughck. Images](http://daverupert.com/2013/06/ughck-images/) by [Dave Rupert](https://twitter.com/davatron5000).

## Installation

Add `jekyll-picture-tag` to your Gemfile in the `:jekyll_plugins` group. For example:

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-picture-tag', '~> 0.2.3'
end
```

It also requires an HTML5 Markdown parser. If you're not using one already, install [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) and add `markdown: redcarpet` to your _config.yml.

Once you have the requirements installed, copy picture_tag.rb into your Jekyll _plugins folder.

## Usage

There are three parts to Jekyll Picture Tag: 

- [Polyfill](#polyfill)
- [Liquid Tag](#liquid-tag)
- [Configuration](#configuration)

### Polyfill

For full browser support, the `picture` markup requires Scott Jehl's [Picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill) polyfill. Download the library and add the script to your site.

The Jekyll Picture Tag requires Picturefill 2.0 and above. If you want to use Picturefill 1.x, you must use [Jekyll Picture Tag 0.2.2](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/jekyll-picture-tag/tree/0.2.2)

### Liquid Tag

```
{% picture [preset] path/to/img.jpg [source_key: path/to/alt/img.jpg] [attribute="value"] %}
```

The tag takes a mix of user input and pointers to configuration settings. 

#### picture

Tells Liquid this is a Jekyll Picture Tag.

#### preset

Optionally specify a picture [preset](#presets) to use, or leave blank for the `default` preset.

#### path/to/img.jpg

The base image that will be resized for your picture sources. Can be a jpeg, png, or gif.

#### source_key: path/to/alt/img.jpg

Optionally specify an alternate base image for a specific picture source. This is one of of picture's strongest features, often reffered to as the [art direction use case](http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#art-direction). 

#### attribute="value"

Optionally specify any number of HTML attributes. These will be merged with any [attributes you've set in a preset](#attr). An attribute set in a tag will override the same attribute set in a preset.

You can set any attribute except for `data-picture`, `data-alt`, `data-src`, and `data-media`.

### Configuration

Jekyll Picture Tag stores settings in an `picture` key in your _config.yml. It takes a minute to set up your presets, but after that generating complex markup with a liquid tag is easy.

**Example settings**

```yml
picture:
  source: "assets/images/_fullsize"
  output: "generated"
  markup: "picture"
  presets:
    default:
      ...
    main:
      ...
    gallery:
      ...
```

**Example preset**

```yml
gallery:
  ppi: [1, 1.5]
  attr:
    class: "gallery-pict"
    itemprop: "image"
  source_medium:
    media: "(min-width: 40em)"
    width: "600"
    height: "300"
  source_default: 
    width: "300"
```

#### source

To make writing tags easier you can specify a source directory for your assets. Base images in the tag will be relative to the `source` directory. 

For example, if `source` is set to `assets/images/_fullsize`, the tag `{% picture enishte/portrait.jpg alt="An unsual picture" %}` will look for a file at `assets/images/_fullsize/enishte/portrait.jpg`.

Defaults to the site source directory.

#### output

Jekyll Picture Tag generates resized images to the `output` directory in your compiled site. The organization of your `source` directory is maintained in the output directory. 

Defaults to `{compiled Jekyll site}/generated`.

*__NOTE:__ `output` must be in a directory that contains other files or it will be erased. This is a [known bug](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/1297) in Jekyll.*

#### markup

Choose `picture` to output markup based on the `<picture>` element. Future options may include `srcset` but have not yet been implemented.

Choose `interchange` to use markup compatible with
[ZURB Foundation's Interchange](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/interchange.html).

#### presets

Presets contain reusable settings for a Jekyll Picture Tag. Each is made up of a list of sources, and an optional attributes list and ppi array.

For example, a `gallery` preset might configure the picture sources for all responsive gallery images on your site, and set a class and some required metadata attributes. If the design changes, you can edit the `gallery` preset and the new settings will apply to every tag that references it.

The `default` preset will be used if no preset is specified in the liquid tag, and is required. A preset name can't contain the `.`, `:`, or `/` characters.

#### attr

Optionally add a list of html attributes to add to the main picturefill span or picture element when the preset is used.

Set the value of standalone attributes to `nil`. You can set any attribute except for `data-picture`, `data-alt`, `data-src`, and `data-media`.

An attribute set in a tag will override the same attribute set in a preset.

#### ppi

Optionally add an array of resolutions to automatically generate high ppi images and sources.

For example, the setting `[1, 1.5, 2]` will create sources that switch to 1.5x sized images on devices with a minimum resolution of 1.5dppx, and 2x images on devices with a minimum resolution of 2dppx. For finer grained control omit `ppi` and write resolution sources by hand.

#### sources

The picture tag uses multiple source elements with individual `src` and `media` attributes. The first source with a matching `media` attribute will be used. Each `source_*` becomes a source element in HTML.

All sources must be prefixed with `source_`. A `source_default` is required. Source names can't contain the `.`, `:`, or `/` characters.

Remember to arrange your sources from most restrictive `media` to the least restrictive. `source_default` does not accept a `media` key, and should always be last.

#### media

Specify a CSS media query in quotes. Each source except for `source_default` requires a `media` attribute. The first source with a matching media attribute will be displayed. You can use any CSS media query.

#### width and height

Set a pixel width and height to resize each source's image appropriately. A single value will scale proportionately; setting both will scale and crop.

## Using Liquid variables and JavaScript templating

You can use liquid variables in a picture tag:

```html
{% picture {{ post.featured_image }} alt="our project" %}
```

If you're using a JavaScript templating library such as Handlebars.js, the templating expression's opening braces must be escaped with backslashes like `\{\{` or `\{\%`. They'll be output as normal `{{ }}` expressions in HTML:

```
{% picture {{ post.featured_image }} alt="\{\{ user_name }}" %}.
```

## Managing Generated Images

Jekyll Picture Tag creates resized versions of your images when you build the site. It uses a smart caching system to speed up site compilation, and re-uses images as much as possible.

Try to use a base image that is larger than the largest resized image you need. Jekyll Picture Tag will warn you if a base image is too small, and won't upscale images.

By specifying a `source` directory that is ignored by Jekyll you can prevent huge base images from being copied to the compiled site. For example, `source: assets/images/_fullsize` and `output: generated` will result in a compiled site that contains resized images but not the originals.

The `output` directory is never deleted by Jekyll. You may want to manually clean it every once in a while to remove unused images.

Responsive images are a good first step to improve performance, but you should still use a build process to optimize site assets before deploying. If you're a cool kid, take a look at [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and [generator-jekyllrb](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb).
