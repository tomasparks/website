>    I can see a future in which any person can have a Node on the [Internet].
>    Any person can be a publisher. It's better than the media we now have. It's possible.

>    [John Perry] Barlow was the first commentator to adopt William Gibson's striking science-fictional term "cyberspace" as a synonym for the present- day nexus of computer and telecommunications networks.
>    Barlow was insistent that cyberspace should be regarded as a qualitatively new world, a 'frontier.'
>    According to Barlow, the world of electronic communications, now made visible through the computer screen,
>    could no longer be usefully regarded as just a tangle of high-tech wiring. Instead, it had become a place, cyberspace,
>    which demanded a new set of metaphors, a new set of rules and behaviors.
>    The term, as Barlow employed it, struck a useful chord, and this concept of cyberspace was picked up by Time,
>    Scientific American, computer police, hackers, and even Constitutional scholars.
>    'Cyberspace' now seems likely to become a permanent fixture of the language.
>    — On the initial founding of the Electronic Frontier Foundation

>    The electronic landscape changes with astounding speed.
>    We are living through the fastest technological transformation in human history.
>    I was glad to have a chance to document cyberspace during one moment in its long mutation;
>    a kind of strobe-flash of the maelstrom.
>    — From the afterword
