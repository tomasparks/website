  description: "Our online life is real life. We walk, talk, work, LOL and even love
    on the Internet \u2013 but we don\u2019t always treat it like real life. Host
    Manoush Zomorodi explores this disconnect with stories from the wilds of the Web,
    and gets to the bottom of online issues that affect us all. Whether it\u2019s
    privacy breaches, closed platforms, hacking, fake news, or cyber bullying, we
    the people have the power to change the course of the Internet, keeping it ethical,
    safe, weird, and wonderful for everyone. IRL is an original podcast from Firefox,
    the tech company backed by Mozilla that believes privacy isn\u2019t a policy.
    It\u2019s a right."
