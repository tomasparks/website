  description: "Our online life is real life. We walk, talk, work, LOL and even love
    on the Internet \u2013 but we don\u2019t always treat it like real life. Host
    Manoush Zomorodi explores this disconnect with stories from the wilds of the Web,
    and gets to the bottom of online issues that affect us all. Whether it\u2019s
    privacy breaches, closed platforms, hacking, fake news, or cyber bullying, we
    the people have the power to change the course of the Internet, keeping it ethical,
    safe, weird, and wonderful for everyone. IRL is an original podcast from Firefox,
    the tech company backed by Mozilla that believes privacy isn\u2019t a policy.
    It\u2019s a right."

    advent of The Internet saw the podcast's audience skyrocket, and now that we're

  description: 'TBH explores how tech businesses got started, how they succeeded or
    failed and what it was like to work in them. Presenter Charles Miller is a former
    BBC producer who specialised in documentaries about technology and business. In
    TBH he continues his research, meeting key people whose stories tell us how technology
    found its way into our lives. In this first series, he talks to those behind the
    dot com boom and bust in the UK in the late 1990s.  '
