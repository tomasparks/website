      name: 139. The Napster Story with Jordan Ritter
      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: 'Napster was an incredible phenomenon, reaching tens of millions of
        users at its height, and though Jordan Ritter didn''t invent Napster, he very
        much was responsible for scaling it and turning it into the phenomenon it
        became. In today''s episode, Jordan recounts the entire Napster story, from
        its gestation in the w00w00 hacker collective (which, by the way, people talk
        a lot about the PayPal mafia, but an argument can be made for a w00w00 mafia)
        all the way through Napster''s legal descent into oblivion. '

        longer than usual. I''ve talked about presentations and why I think they''re
        important here and there, but I try to lay it all down here, give you some
        pointers and thoughts, and hopefully inspire you to make your own. And I give
        an offer at the end. I''m always experimenting, so the podcast is not nailed
        down into a specific processed style that would come from a team working on
        it - so this episode is very dynamic and energetic. Learning my limits and
        what works and doesn''t is always important, as well as your feedback.'

      content: "\_ When the Door Rolls Up, The Last Cache of Commodore, One More Time
        About the Manuals, Rusted Amigas, Money Money Money, The Meaning of it All.
        A pleasant enough essay about the nature of piles of \"stuff\" I get offered
        or that fall into my lap. Why does this happen? What are my thoughts on it?
        Here's a good starting overview of this aspect of history. I will say that
        the Great Patreon Stumble of 2017 has encouraged me to decentralize this podcast
        and contributions, which I bet will be good for me in the long run - so there's
        a silver lining. More than a few people are asking me to consider adding interview
        episodes to this podcast. I'd honestly like to ask you all what you think
        of that. I assume it'd be me and someone interesting talking for an hour,
        and then turning that into something smooth. It sure wouldn't be 20 minutes,
        and I am of the opinion it's basically another whole type of show. Maybe a
        bonus scattered here and there? I just don't see how it fits in the format
        and folks who like the sub-30-minutes running time will find themselves really
        behind. Well, let me know.  \_ \_"

        I went to as a kid, as well as how it all wrapped in with computers and my
        desires to at once escape and be part of something.  I''ve been really enjoying
        these sessions at Beacon Soundworks, who have been dealing with my flexible
        schedule and near-random recording sessions with a truly professional air.
        Mike, the owner, is a gem; I''m delighted to work with him to book these times.
        I''m getting good feedback from folks, and the notes are always appreciated.

        is very, very loose. I also didn''t have my pop shield out here, so apologies
        to your speakers. I mention the Patreon stupid and also offer PODCAST.TEXTFILES.COM
        as the secure central information and donation vector for this podcast going
        forward. It has been quite the ride watching support drop and return for this
        Patreon, and I don''t need more uncertainty in my life, thanks.  Opinion seems
        to float that people would like an interview show or similar, but I''d probably
        make it a bonus, because it would be different than this format, and notably
        longer. We''ll see when that happens, but it''s on my mind. Next episodes
        will be much less miscellaneous, but it felt great to talk about it all. Thanks
        for riding along.'

      content: Andy. With the close of the year comes the exciting prospect of how
        next year's taxes will be handled. Naturally, I'll be having an accountant
        help me. I bring this up as I have multiple times in the past because I've
        run into a number of people who have tax issues who are some sort of ashamed
        that they're experiencing problems or bumps, and feel in some way this makes
        them look bad. If I may, please let me be the first to say that taxes are
        not intuitive and you can't just wing them or think it's something you might
        get perfectly right going it alone. This is doubly the case now that the tax
        laws are changing. Don't avoid dealing with them, like I did. Next up for
        me regarding this podcast will be refining delivery and process. It's fun
        to learn on the way.

      one to shape into a cohesive whole. I'm glad I did it, but I look forward to
      more about beeps, boops and laughter.  This podcast is supported by a Patreon

      I'm intending to stick around.\_"

      content: "Last week, Mike sparked lots of conversation with his post about rethinking
        the marketplace of ideas without losing sight of the importance of the fundamental
        principles of free speech. Naturally, there's plenty more to discuss on that
        topic, so this week we're joined by Buzzfeed general counsel Nabiha Syed \u2014
        whose recent article in the Yale Law Journal, Real Talk About Fake News, offered
        a thorough and insightful look at free speech online \u2014 to try to cut

        epic legal battle over intellectual property went through nearly a decade
        of rulings and reversals, and the resulting story is a fascinating one that
        ties in a lot of the topics we discuss here at Techdirt. It's also the subject
        of the new book You Don't Own Me by law professor Orly Lobel, who joins us
        on this week's episode to revisit this particular law opera and what it says
        about the wider world of IP."

      name: Facebook Won't Save Democracy
      author: Techdirt
      content: In the midst of the political chaos in America and the world at large,
        a whole lot of attention has been turned to Facebook and its role in modern
        democracy. The social network has responded by announcing another round of
        news feed changes, the true impact of which (if any) remains far from clear.
        This week, we're joined by Mathew Ingram from the Columbia Journalism Review
        to talk about Facebook's changes, and whether we can or should expect them
        to fix anything.

      author: Techdirt
      content: 'When it comes to many of the legislative issues of interest to us
        here at Techdirt, we''ve always been able to count on at least one voice of
        reason amidst the congressional chaos: Representative Zoe Lofgren from California.
        In addition to playing a critical role in the fight against SOPA, she continues
        to be a voice of reason against bad copyright policy, expansive government
        surveillance, and the broken CFAA, among many other things. This week, she
        joins Mike on the podcast for a wide-ranging discussion about these topics
        and more.'

        is fake, audience numbers are garbage, and nobody knows how many people see
        anything. My feelings haven't changed much, and neither has the digital advertising
        ecosystem. And since regular podcast co-host Dennis Yang runs a digital metrics
        company, it only made sense for us to hash it out on an episode all about
        audience measurement and how it shapes online advertising.\r\n\r\n2016 Post:

      name: Disrupting Google
      author: Techdirt
      content: "When a tech company is huge and dominant, it can feel like competing
        with them is impossible. Worse still, it can sometimes feel like innovating
        is impossible, since they might just step in and take over as soon as someone
        executes on a good idea. Once upon a time this was how startups felt about
        Microsoft, while today it's more likely to be Google or Facebook. But no company,
        no matter how mighty, is immune to being disrupted \u2014 and figuring out
        how is the subject of this week's episode."

    content: In the midst of the political chaos in America and the world at large,
      a whole lot of attention has been turned to Facebook and its role in modern
      democracy. The social network has responded by announcing another round of news
      feed changes, the true impact of which (if any) remains far from clear. This
      week, we're joined by Mathew Ingram from the Columbia Journalism Review to talk
      about Facebook's changes, and whether we can or should expect them to fix anything.

      author: Techdirt
      content: Even those of us who believe that the internet is overall a tremendous
        positive force when it comes to discourse and culture can admit that, in many
        parts of the online world, having constructive and substantive conversations
        is... difficult. And that issue has most certainly come to the fore in the
        last couple of years. So this week, we're joined by author Barry Eisler (one
        of our first and most frequent podcast guests) to tackle the challenge of
        framing important debates in productive ways, and actually getting somewhere
        with them.

    name: Games That Tell Stories
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Gaming is changing the nature of storytelling. Video games of course
      \u2014 but also the modern rise of board games, tabletop RPGs and other forms
      of analog gaming. A good game does more than just arbitrarily pair play with
      a veneer of narrative, it marries the mechanics and the ideas to enable interesting
      new ways of conveying and exploring complex ideas. This week, we're joined by
      game designer Randy Lubin to discuss how games can tell stories in a way nothing
      else can."

      content: "Plato was an online and interactive learning computer system developed
        in the 1960s at the University of Illinois. But in the early 1970s, Plato
        got truly networked, and the users took over. Plato had already pioneered
        such things as touch screen computing, but the kids introduced and pioneered
        concepts like forums, message boards, e-mail, chat rooms, instant messaging,
        multiplayer games and even emoticons/emojis were pioneered on the Plato system.\r\n\r\nBuy

        of music online at dotcom-era companies N2K and MyPlay, and competing directly
        against iTunes when he was at eMusic. As a bonus, he gives us some background
        on the more recent founding story of Dollar Shave Club."

        little fresher, so by now you almost certainly know all about the copyright
        claims on Donald Trump's appearances on the Howard Stern show. Though delayed
        by an outage at our cloud recording provider, the episode is still an interesting
        listen, with frequent Techdirt contributor Cathy Gellis joining the podcast
        to discuss the deeper question of whether copyright truly even exists on the
        interviews in the first place. Sorry for the delay, and we hope you enjoy
        it!

      content: 'As smartphones and other mobile devices have gotten smarter and smarter,
        they''ve taken over more and more of most people''s general computing needs,
        and the importance of the classic personal computer has waned. And so for
        some time the question has been: will the PC ever go away entirely? That''s
        our topic this week as we try to figure out who really needs a PC these days,

      author: Techdirt
      content: "The rapid forward march of technology has long bred two leading camps
        of onlookers: the techno-optimists and the techno-pessimists. Honest people
        on both sides, however, must admit that technological innovation has had both
        positive and negative effects. Internet legend Tim O'Reilly is one of the
        people who think a lot about these issues, and his new book WTF? What's the
        Future and Why It's Up to Us \u2014 which discusses in detail the world that
        we are building with technology \u2014 was released today, and we're pleased
        to have him join us on this week's episode to talk about the book and the
        future of innovation."

        we're all well aware of the conversation about Facebook's role in the presidential
        election, including questions of filter bubbles, fake news, foreign influence,
        and so on and so on. As is always the case in situations like this, a lot
        of people seem to be looking for easy answers, and easy places to point fingers
        of blame, so in this week's episode we're discussing why it's just not that
        simple."

    author: Techdirt
    content: This episode was supposed to come two weeks ago when the news was a little
      fresher, so by now you almost certainly know all about the copyright claims
      on Donald Trump's appearances on the Howard Stern show. Though delayed by an
      outage at our cloud recording provider, the episode is still an interesting
      listen, with frequent Techdirt contributor Cathy Gellis joining the podcast
      to discuss the deeper question of whether copyright truly even exists on the
      interviews in the first place. Sorry for the delay, and we hope you enjoy it!

      author: Techdirt
      content: Facebook is under a lot of scrutiny these days over its advertising
        and content moderation systems, especially since the high-profile revelation
        of Russia-backed ads during the election. But are things being blown out of
        proportion? And what, exactly, is to be done? This week we dig in to Facebook's
        ongoing advertising scandals, and debate what they really mean.

      name: 'Ep 46: Dr. Azra Raza on Mouse Model Misconceptions & Other Ways We Can
        Improve Cancer Research'
      author: Adam Ruins Everything
      content: "When we think of conducting science experiments on subjects, we immediately
        think of mice models. But today's guest, Dr. Azra Raza, who appeared on Adam
        Ruins Science, says there's a more effective way. On the TV show Dr. Raza
        discussed how the mouse model scientists use for their research is actually
        ineffective; even though a medicine might work well on a rodent, the results
        don't translate as well as we thought to humans - especially when it comes
        to cancer research which is what Dr. Raza studies. Even though humans and
        mice share over 90 percent of their DNA with one another, our bodies still
        differ in numerous ways; we metabolize food and medicine differently and humans
        are significantly bigger than mice in size. This wastes money from the limited
        amount of funding that already exists and encourages clinical trials that
        ultimately go nowhere. On the podcast, Dr. Raza proposes a different research
        method that she has used herself, to much success.\r\n\r\nDr. Raza is a Professor
        of Medicine and Director of the MDS Center at Columbia University in New York.
        Previously she conducted her research at Rush University, Chicago, Illinois
        in 1992, where she was the Charles Arthur Weaver Professor in Oncology and
        Director, Division of Myeloid Diseases.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter @AdamConover

        Video Games'
      author: Adam Ruins Everything
      content: "Do you remember all of those video games that were made for girls
        back in the 90s? Well they're not being archived the same way that stereotypical
        boy games are being preserved. They don't have value in the gaming community
        and many of these games are being forgotten even though they were just as
        creative and innovative for the industry. Our guest Rachel Weil is trying
        to change that by preserving these 'girl' games by going around the world
        and collecting these games and talking to the people who made them. She is
        a software developer for Microsoft and the founder of the Femicom Museum,
        \ a hybrid physical/digital museum and archive dedicated to the preservation
        and reimagination of femininity, girlhood, and the aesthetics of cute within
        twentieth-century video games, computing, and electronic toys. Rachel did
        not appear on the Adam Ruins Everything TV show but her work reminded us of
        the themes we explored in our Adam Ruins Summer Fun episode. And since we're
        in the off-season of the TV show, we'll be inviting more guests onto the podcast
        whose work relates to themes we explored on the TV show or who are doing fascinating
        work or research that's worth discussing anyway. On the podcast Adam and Rachel
        had a lively discussion about gender expectations, the negative effects of
        marketing towards girls and boys, their favorite classic games and even their
        favorite savory breakfasts.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter @AdamConover and you
        can find past episodes and bonus content from the TruTV show at AdamRuinsEverything.com.\r\n\r\nProduced

        What once seemed like a fringe movement, conspiracy theories appear more pervasive than ever. Our guest Dr. Daniel Jolley points out, conspiracy theories have been around for centuries; social media, however, has given them a wider platform and megaphone. Believing in such theories can seem like harmless speculation. But if enough people accept ideas like the faking of the moon landing or 9/11 being a government inside job, they'll feel they have no agency. This can lead to very dangerous effects like lower voter turnout and less civic engagement at large. Daniel, who appeared on Adam Ruins Conspiracy Theories, explains why people believe in conspiracy theories in the first place, how people can believe in two contradictory conspiracy theories, and how we can combat these theories to create a healthier democracy. He studies conspiracy theories at Staffordshire University in the United Kingdom.

      author: Adam Ruins Everything
      content: "Placebos are commonly dismissed as \"fake\" treatments that have no
        real power on you or your body. But scientists are realizing more and more
        that placebos are more powerful than we realized. New research shows that
        while placebos may not cure diseases, they can reduce symptoms of our ailments
        like irritable bowel syndrome and even Parkinson's disease, and in the process
        actually make us feel better. Even traditional medicine takes advantage of
        the placebo effect, which could mean the placebo effect could play a significant
        role in treating diseases. On this episode we talk to Dr. Kathryn Hall, who
        appeared on Adam Ruins Spa Day, about how placebos can have such powerful
        effects on our brains and how placebos are changing the way we conduct science
        and treat patients. Kathryn is a molecular biologist and Director of Placebo

      author: Adam Ruins Everything
      content: "As humans, our inclination is to live in the present - not save 40
        years down the line - which makes saving money for retirement hard. In the
        90s many companies began offering 401(k) programs, a retirement savings plan
        sponsored by an employer which lets workers save and invest a piece of their
        paycheck before taxes. It seemed like the perfect solution to our retirement
        woes. But 401(k)s aren't the full proof saving plan we once thought. Even
        judiciously setting aside money in a 401(k) might not be enough to maintain
        one's lifestyle into retirement. There are also so many outside factors that
        can still diminish one's savings, including unexpected healthcare costs, recessions,
        or lost jobs. So how do we set ourselves up for a secure financial future?\r\n\r\nOur
        guest Professor Teresa Ghilarducci, who appeared on Adam Ruins the Future,
        is going to tell us how we entered into this financial mess and how we can
        get out of it. She suggests we do the best we can to save through 401(k)s,
        live within our means, start planning our financial future as young as we
        can, delay collecting social security as much as we can, and vote for representatives
        who can help reform this system. Teresa is a labor economist and nationally-recognized
        expert in retirement security. She's also a professor of economics at The

      down the line - which makes saving money for retirement hard. In the 90s many
      companies began offering 401(k) programs, a retirement savings plan sponsored
      by an employer which lets workers save and invest a piece of their paycheck
      before taxes. It seemed like the perfect solution to our retirement woes. But
      401(k)s aren't the full proof saving plan we once thought. Even judiciously
      setting aside money in a 401(k) might not be enough to maintain one's lifestyle
      into retirement. There are also so many outside factors that can still diminish
      one's savings, including unexpected healthcare costs, recessions, or lost jobs.
      So how do we set ourselves up for a secure financial future?\r\n\r\nOur guest
      Professor Teresa Ghilarducci, who appeared on Adam Ruins the Future, is going
      to tell us how we entered into this financial mess and how we can get out of
      it. She suggests we do the best we can to save through 401(k)s, live within
      our means, start planning our financial future as young as we can, delay collecting
      social security as much as we can, and vote for representatives who can help
      reform this system. Teresa is a labor economist and nationally-recognized expert
      in retirement security. She's also a professor of economics at The New School
      for Social Research.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter @AdamConover and you can find
      past episodes and bonus content from the TruTV show at AdamRuinsEverything.com.\r\n\r\nProduced
      by Shara Morris for MaximumFun.org."

      author: Adam Ruins Everything
      content: "While they may sport perfectly manicured lawns and beautiful white
        picket fences, suburbs are not the idyllic neighborhoods we think they are.
        They make us more sedentary, sometimes less safe, and they can even perpetuate
        segregation. But instead of leaving the suburbs we can actually address these
        issues and improve our suburbs through redevelopment and retrofitting neighborhoods
        to make them greener, healthier, safer and more affordable. Our guest Ellen
        Dunham-Jones, who appeared on Adam Ruins the Suburbs, tells us all about it.
        She has spent her career studying how suburbs can adapt to these 21st century
        challenges. Ellen is a leading authority on suburban redevelopment and is
        the Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at Georgia Tech.\r\n\r\nAdam

      author: Techdirt
      content: "Law isn't simple, and truly learning about it takes more than a few
        short primers or even an in-depth guide or two \u2014 which makes it the perfect
        topic to explore via the medium of podcasts. This week, we've got a pair of
        guests who are doing exactly that: Ken White of Popehat fame, who recently
        launched the Make No Law podcast about First Amendment issues, and Elizabeth
        Joh, co-host of the What Trump Can Teach Us About Constitutional Law podcast.
        Instead of picking their brains about the law itself, we've got an episode
        all about their experience using podcasts to teach people about legal issues."

      content: "People have been yelling at me for years that I\u2019ve not covered
        more technical aspects of the web\u2019s history, especially things like Java.
        Specifically Java. The argument can be made that Java helped the web evolve
        into what it\u2019s become. So, that\u2019s why I was thrilled to sit down
        with Todd Sundsted, who is a developer who has been working with Java for
        more than 20 years. Todd walks us through the history of Java and why it is
        so important to the web\u2019s general evolution."

      author: Techdirt
      content: Social media can be an extremely powerful tool for gathering, finding
        and sharing the news. It can also be... a bit of a disaster. It would be nice
        if such an important question had a simple answer, but they never do, do they?
        So this week, we're discussing and dissecting whether or not social media
        is "good" for the way we consume the news.

      name: Is "Free" Bad?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "In the last few years, a lot of the conversation around technology
        in general has shifted its focus from excitement about the obvious benefits
        to concern about its downfalls and side effects. It even feels like there's
        a general sense that \"technology is bad for society\" in a lot of places.
        This comes with a lot of associated myths, including the prominent idea that
        \"if you're not paying for something, you're the product being sold\" \u2014
        an idea that is, at best a massive oversimplification. So on this week's podcast
        we're discussing the changing cultural attitudes towards technology, especially
        free online services and the many myths and misunderstandings about how they
        operate."

        The party attempts to infiltrate the seedy underbelly of Ezry to track down Skullis -- a notorious R. Cane dealer and killer of Stunkbug's brother. Hardwon becomes a prize fighter, Moonshine is hellbent on stealing a little blue hat, Beverly becomes a valet, and Stunkbug comes face to face with his nemesis, who is much different than he remembers. Adam Conover joins us!

      content: "Coming into this episode I didn't really know much about service workers.
        I assumed there were very specific use cases for them, but Jeremy opened our
        eyes to the fact that they allow access to some very powerful browser features
        and are useful across the board.\n\nWe also spoke about Jeremy's recently
        released A Book Apart Book 'Going Offline', I'm really enjoying it. I can't
        put it any better than Sarah Drasner (https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com), who
        said:\n\n\"Jeremy Keith explains service workers with kindness, clarity, and
        humour in his new book, a must-read for any web developer who wants to learn
        this exciting new API and enable offline experiences for their applications.\"\n\nThe
        first chapter is available as an A List Apart article, link below. \n\nThere
        were some strong Jukebox Entries this time. Jeremy Chose Catastrophe And The
        Cure by Explosions In The Sky, from one of my very favourite albums. Ben chose
        The Celestial Garden by DrumTalk but apparently described a different track
        in the episode, he's a sleep deprived new dad so we'll have mercy on him for
        that. My pick was Bashed Out by This Is The Kit, a lovely bitter sweet track.
        \n\nJeremy's and Ben's tracks are added to the Relative Paths Playlist (https://relativepaths.uk/pl),
        mine goes on the Relative Paths Alt Playlist (http://relativepaths.uk/altpl)
        for tracks with lyrics.\n\nJeremy also plays slide bouzouki for Brighton based

        them a listen.\n\nLinks: \nJeremy's Site - https://adactio.com\nGoing Offline,

    name: '52: Going Offline | with Jeremy Keith'
    author: Mark Phoenix and Ben Hutchings
    content: "Coming into this episode I didn't really know much about service workers.
      I assumed there were very specific use cases for them, but Jeremy opened our
      eyes to the fact that they allow access to some very powerful browser features
      and are useful across the board.\n\nWe also spoke about Jeremy's recently released
      A Book Apart Book 'Going Offline', I'm really enjoying it. I can't put it any
      better than Sarah Drasner (https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com), who said:\n\n\"Jeremy
      Keith explains service workers with kindness, clarity, and humour in his new
      book, a must-read for any web developer who wants to learn this exciting new
      API and enable offline experiences for their applications.\"\n\nThe first chapter
      is available as an A List Apart article, link below. \n\nThere were some strong
      Jukebox Entries this time. Jeremy Chose Catastrophe And The Cure by Explosions
      In The Sky, from one of my very favourite albums. Ben chose The Celestial Garden
      by DrumTalk but apparently described a different track in the episode, he's
      a sleep deprived new dad so we'll have mercy on him for that. My pick was Bashed
      Out by This Is The Kit, a lovely bitter sweet track. \n\nJeremy's and Ben's
      tracks are added to the Relative Paths Playlist (https://relativepaths.uk/pl),
      mine goes on the Relative Paths Alt Playlist (http://relativepaths.uk/altpl)
      for tracks with lyrics.\n\nJeremy also plays slide bouzouki for Brighton based
      band Salter Cane. Link to their site is below, I'd definitely recommend giving
      them a listen.\n\nLinks: \nJeremy's Site - https://adactio.com\nGoing Offline,

        Robert is the author of a book that was probably one of the biggest reasons
        I started doing this podcast. The book was Architects of the Web, 1000 Days
        that Built the Future of Business. It was one of the first books to come out
        about the history of the web era. It was published in 1997, "

    content: "Summary:\r\nRobert Reid, the founder of Rhapsody, can be considered
      the Godfather (founding father?) of the streaming music reality we now live
      in.\_But guess what? That's only half of this episode! Because it turns out,
      Robert is the author of a book that was probably one of the biggest reasons
      I started doing this podcast. The book was Architects of the Web, 1000 Days
      that Built the Future of Business. It was one of the first books to come out
      about the history of the web era. It was published in 1997, "

      author: The Planetary Society
      content: "The New Horizons mission was a triumph, revealing Pluto as an utterly
        unique and beautiful world. But the mission first had to survive challenge
        after challenge, fighting to be developed, meeting a nearly impossible launch
        deadline, and then narrowly avoiding disaster when it was barely a week from
        its destination. The entire dramatic tale has now been told by Principal Investigator
        Alan Stern and his co-author, astrobiologist David Grinspoon.&nbsp; They join
        Mat Kaplan to talk about their book, Chasing New Horizons\u2014Inside the
        Epic First Mission to Pluto.&nbsp; A signed copy of the book will go to the
        winner of this episode\u2019s space trivia contest.&nbsp; Emily Lakdawalla
        has returned from an international gathering of Mercury scientists with a
        special report.&nbsp; The Planetary Society\u2019s Senior Editor also marks
        the launch of a Chinese lunar orbiter.&nbsp; Learn more about this week\u2019s

      author: Techdirt
      content: "When the \"death of the MP3\" started being reported, we were among
        the very few blogs that said umm, no \u2014 but the deluge of eulogies for
        the still-thriving format has been overwhelming and quite surprising. This
        week I join the podcast to discuss why the MP3 isn't dead, and how so much
        of the tech press got it so wrong."

      author: Techdirt
      content: 'You may have heard the joke: the best way to do product design for
        Facebook is to get a job at Snapchat. We''ve all seen how, after failing to
        buy the company, Facebook has wasted little time in building its own versions
        of most of Snapchat''s key features. So... is this a problem? That''s the
        subject on this week''s episode, were we discuss the ins and outs of this
        kind of copying and what it might mean for the future of social media.'

      author: Techdirt
      content: One of the fundamental strengths of the internet has always been its
        decentralization, but over time we've seen a bunch of different forces start
        to distort this setup. This week, we're joined by Jamie King, director of
        Steal This Film and host of the Steal This Show podcast to discuss the ongoing
        efforts to restore the decentralization of the web.

      content: "Smartphones have been one of the most world-changing innovations of
        our time \u2014 and for a long time, smartphone design was a hotbed of innovation.
        But more recently that innovation seems to have stagnated. So where does this
        technology go next? That's the subject of this weeks episode, in which we
        try to figure out whether smartphone innovation is still happening."

        by the government. He joins us this week on the podcast to discuss the ins

      content: "This week's episode is all about copyright and culture, with a pair
        of the best guests you could ask for on the subject. Almost ten years ago,
        law professors Keith Aoki, James Boyle and Jennifer Jenkins released a comic
        book about copyright called Bound By Law, and now they are back with a sequel:
        Theft: A History of Music. This week, James and Jennifer join us to discuss
        the new comic and the history of copyright and music (with lots of fair use
        music snippets to demonstrate the legacy of 'theft')!\r\n\r\nYou should also
        be sure to check out the comic itself! You can download a digital copy for
        free of course, but for those who want to get their hands on the beautiful
        paperback edition, we've got a limited time offer for Techdirt fans: you can
        get it for only $8.99 at Createspace (that's 40% off!) when you use the discount
        code 2FESBPRQ within the next two weeks. It's also available on Amazon with
        a free Kindle edition included when you buy."

This week, James and Jennifer join us to discuss the new comic and the history of copyright and music (with lots of fair use music snippets to demonstrate the legacy of 'theft')!\r\n\r\nYou should also be sure to check out the comic itself! You can download a digital copy for free of course, but for those who want to get their hands on the beautiful paperback edition, we've got a limited time offer for Techdirt fans: you can get it for only $8.99 at Createspace (that's 40% off!) when you use the discount code 2FESBPRQ within the next two weeks.

    name: Copyright, Music & 'Theft'
    author: Techdirt
    content: "This week's episode is all about copyright and culture, with a pair
      of the best guests you could ask for on the subject. Almost ten years ago, law
      professors Keith Aoki, James Boyle and Jennifer Jenkins released a comic book
      about copyright called Bound By Law, and now they are back with a sequel: Theft:
      A History of Music. This week, James and Jennifer join us to discuss the new
      comic and the history of copyright and music (with lots of fair use music snippets
      to demonstrate the legacy of 'theft')!\r\n\r\nYou should also be sure to check
      out the comic itself! You can download a digital copy for free of course, but
      for those who want to get their hands on the beautiful paperback edition, we've
      got a limited time offer for Techdirt fans: you can get it for only $8.99 at
      Createspace (that's 40% off!) when you use the discount code 2FESBPRQ within
      the next two weeks. It's also available on Amazon with a free Kindle edition
      included when you buy."

      content: "In the post-Snowden era, we don't have to tell you how important it
        is to stay engaged with (and vigilant about) the surveillance state in America.
        Jennifer Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center
        for Internet and Society, and author of the new book American Spies \u2014
        and this week she joins us for an in-depth discussion about the surveillance
        state today. Of course, shortly after we recorded this podcast, the NSA made
        major changes to one of its surveillance programs, so Jennifer returned to
        record an addendum examining this latest news, so make sure you listen to
        the end!"

      author: Techdirt
      content: "The current instalment of the crypto wars hit full stride with the
        clash between Apple and the FBI, but in truth the tension over encryption
        has been around for a long time \u2014 and it doesn't look like it's going
        away anytime soon. As our readers know, Tim Cushing has been following these
        developments closely, and this week he joins the podcast for a discussion
        about encryption, law enforcement and \"going dark\"."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "For a long time now, \"use a VPN\" has been the default online privacy
        advice \u2014 but is it really so effective? Following the recent VPN boom
        that came on the tails of Congress scrapping new ISP privacy rules, a few
        security experts have stepped forward to explain how VPNs aren't all they're
        cracked up to be, and choosing and using one isn't as easy as many articles
        and social media posts suggest. Among them are this week's guests, Kevin Riggle
        (who provided a quick and dirty primer with the key suggestion that most people
        are safer not using a VPN) and Kenn White (who assembled a list of VPNs he
        deems \"terrible\" and not without good reason, recommending a roll-your-own
        solution instead). They join us to dig deeper into the reality of VPNs and
        hopefully help some people make better choices."

      author: Techdirt
      content: 'The basic impetus behind DRM is obvious: a frantic, misguided desire
        to make digital products behave like physical ones. But the truth is DRM goes
        far, far beyond that, restricting all sorts of activities that are intrinsic
        to the idea of "owning" something. Two people who have thought a lot about
        this are law professors Aaron Perzanowski and Jason Schultz, authors of the
        new book The End Of Ownership. This week, Aaron and Jason join the podcast
        to discuss the book and the worrying status of DRM today.'

      author: Techdirt
      content: Since Congress threw out new privacy rules for ISPs that were supposed
        to come into effect soon, there's been a renewed uproar on all sides of the
        debate about internet regulation. While the big ISPs generally want to be
        able to do as they please, there are smaller service providers out there that
        fully understand and embrace the need for privacy, net neutrality and more.
        One such ISP is Sonic, and this week we're joined by CEO Dane Jasper to discuss
        why these rules are a good thing.

      author: Techdirt
      content: 'It doesn''t take many stories of people suffering due to unaffordable
        medicine to make you question the state of pharmaceutical patents, but the
        arguments in their defense are loud and frequent. Most are variations on the
        same theme: without the promise of a monopoly, important drugs would never
        be researched and developed. But does this argument truly hold up? It''s come
        up as a tangent in previous episodes of the podcast, but this week we''re
        dedicating a full episode to questioning the popular defenses of pharma patents
        and looking for a better way forward.'

      content: "From its humble origins as an online bookseller that many people worried
        might not survive, Amazon has grown into a critical piece of the web's backbone
        via its Amazon Web Services platform. Last week's S3 outage made this painfully
        clear, and understandably raised lots of concerns \u2014 especially after
        it was revealed that the whole thing was caused by a typo. So this week we're
        discussing whether something needs to be done, and what that might be."

      author: Techdirt
      content: Innovation isn't easy, but success in Silicon Valley involves a bigger
        dose of luck than a lot of entrepreneurs seem prepared to admit. Chance gets
        left out of the economic equation all too often, and this week we're joined
        by Mike's own Econ 101 professor from Cornell, Robert Frank, to discuss the
        role of luck in the world of entrepreneurs and innovation.

        an architect of Google's airline reservation system, to talk about all the
        technology behind commercial air travel today.

        a look at the Consumer Electronics Show with the help of journalist Rob Pegoraro.
        So this year, we've brought Rob back for another look at the highs and lows

      author: Techdirt
      content: Net neutrality is at risk. The FCC under Ajit Pai is clearly intent
        on destroying it, and this is quickly turning into a fight for the future
        of the internet. This week, we're joined by Gigi Sohn, one of former chairman
        Tom Wheeler top advisors at the FCC and now a fellow at the Open Society Foundation,
        to discuss what's happening at the FCC and what needs to be done in response.

      content: On the surface, the idea of "pro and con" debates seems like a good
        way to ensure an issue is fully explored. But is it truly a productive approach?
        This week, we debate the nature of debates and possible alternatives to the
        adversarial approach.

        here on the podcast a couple years ago, but today we're digging more deeply
        the impact this is having, especially on policy. R Street Institute senior
        fellow Ian Adams joins us as a special guest this week for a discussion about
        the many implications of this accelerating technological shift.

      author: Techdirt
      content: "The internet of things has been taking plenty of flack ever since
        the first time someone floated the idea of a connected fridge or some-such
        in the 90s \u2014 but despite the knee-jerk instinct to scoff at some things,
        the truth is there are all sorts of interesting possibilities emerging from
        all these \"pointless\" connected devices. Of course, there are also some
        serious security concerns... This week, we discuss IoT and what the ever-increasing
        presence of such devices means for the future."

      name: Changing Government Starts With You
      author: Techdirt
      content: For obvious reasons, politics and government are on just about everyone's
        mind at the moment, prompting a vast range of reactions and opinions. A lot
        of people who share a desire for change are divided not only by what form
        they think that change should take, but by what methods they think should
        be employed to achieve it. Former Senate staffer and long-time Techdirt friend
        Jennifer Hoelzer recently wrote a column entitled Your Government Won't Change...
        Unless You Do and this week she joins us on the podcast to delve further into
        this idea and what it means for optimists, cynics, pragmatists and everyone
        else.

      name: Where Do You Get Your News?
      author: Techdirt
      content: The news industry has been in an ongoing state of upheaval ever since
        the dawn of the internet. In addition to the many ways that technology changes
        reporting and publishing, there has also been a profound effect on how people
        find their news. This week, we step away from the big debate about echo chambers
        and filter bubbles, and talk about evolving news-finding habits and what they
        mean for the industry.

      name: Can We Really Colonize Mars?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Elon Musk got plenty of attention recently for announcing his plans
        to colonize Mars. But that's not exactly a new idea \u2014 so we wondered
        if it was really a different, exciting and realistic plan, or just a reiteration
        of the standard far-flung dream. To answer that question, we brought in three
        experts: Amy Shira Teitel (a space and flight historian and creator of YouTube's
        Vintage Space videos), JPL's Fred Calef (a Mars geologist and \"keeper of
        the maps\" for Mars rovers), and the New Space Intiative's Tanya Harrison
        (who worked on Curiosity and several other Mars missions). The result was
        a fascinating discussion about Mars and whether or not we're actually headed
        there any time soon."

    name: Is The Internet Of Things The Future, A Total Mess, Or Both?
    author: Techdirt
    content: "The internet of things has been taking plenty of flack ever since the
      first time someone floated the idea of a connected fridge or some-such in the
      90s \u2014 but despite the knee-jerk instinct to scoff at some things, the truth
      is there are all sorts of interesting possibilities emerging from all these
      \"pointless\" connected devices. Of course, there are also some serious security
      concerns--- This week, we discuss IoT and what the ever-increasing presence
      of such devices means for the future."

      author: Techdirt
      content: 'Well, today''s the day. By tomorrow there will be a new President
        of the United States, and a large segment of the population claiming that
        they were robbed by the system. But immediate anger aside, that system is
        hardly above criticism: the Electoral College has had all sorts of unanticipated
        and often undesirable effects on democracy, and a wide variety of alternatives
        have been proposed. This week we discuss the question: is there a better way
        to pick the president?'

      author: Techdirt
      content: "Though the notion of the Facebook \"filter bubble\" has been around
        for a while, it's picked up a huge amount of steam following the election
        of Donald Trump \u2014 perhaps just a little too much steam. While Techdirt
        has long been of the opinion that pointing fingers at Facebook is misguided,
        there are plenty of people who disagree. This week, we're joined by one such
        person \u2014 long-time media commentator and senior editor at Fortune Mathew
        Ingram \u2014 for a lively debate about just how much of a problem the filter
        bubble really is, and how you'd go about solving it."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "Software patents have been dubious since their inception \u2014 not
        just in principle, but legally too. Past rulings have called their validity
        into serious question, and now an opinion from a prominent pro-patent judge
        has called for people to admit that they simply shouldn't exist. This week,
        we discuss what this opinion means for the (hopefully short) future of software
        patents."

      content: We wanted to do an episode all about examining the tech policy platforms
        of the 2016 presidential candidates, but that proved impossible since one
        candidate's is vague and noncommittal while the other's doesn't exist at all.
        Since a nuanced discussion about robust tech policy platforms was probably
        a bit much to hope for from this election anyway, for this week's episode
        we're discussing what a great presidential tech platform should look like
        under less absurd circumstances.

      content: "Data breaches that expose passwords are pretty much a fact of life
        at this point \u2014 and the effects are multiplied by the fact that many,
        many people reuse passwords no matter how much they know they shouldn't. As
        such, there's a big push to move to password managers, two-factor authentication,
        and even biometrics \u2014 because the simple fact is the password sucks.
        This week, we're discussing what if anything will succeed in replacing it."

        protocol might be coming to an end, supplanted by the drive to create proprietary
        closed platforms. This week, we discuss whether the open protocol is dead,

        over the billionaire vendetta that brought it down, we've faced a huge amount
        of pushback from people who had problems with the site and its reporting practices.
        This week, we're joined by Parker Thompson aka Startup L. Jackson for a friendly
        debate about whether the Gawker shutdown really is a big deal.

      name: Is Facebook Moderation A Necessary Evil?
      author: Techdirt
      content: Facebook's efforts to moderate content that appears on the social network
        have run into numerous problems, most recently with a famous war photo and
        a bunch of blog posts. Some have made absurd demands in response, such as
        giving old-school media editors special posting privileges, while others have
        objected to the idea of Facebook censoring any content whatsoever. But is
        that objection realistic? This week, we discuss the complicated question of
        Facebook moderation, and what the company's role can and should be.

      author: Techdirt
      content: Ira Rothken is on the front lines of many major legal battles relating
        to copyright and piracy, including defending Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom
        and, most recently, taking up the defense of Kickass Torrents operator Artem
        Vaulin. This week, Ira joins us on the podcast to discuss the ins and outs
        of these and other cases where the entertainment industry has come down hard
        on consumers and innovators.

      name: Inside A Really Good Kickstarter Campaign
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Not all Kickstarter campaigns are created equal. Even the mostly-good
        ones that eventually satisfy their backers are often plagued with delays and
        poor communication. But once in a while, there's a campaign that runs smoothly,
        communicates openly, and delivers a great product on time as promised \u2014
        and Minaal is one company that pulled off such a campaign to launch its line
        of travel bags. This week, we're joined by co-founder Jimmy Hayes to discuss
        how they pulled it off and what their experience can teach us about other
        campaigns and the broader crowdfunding ecosystem."

      name: Pardon Snowden
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Edward Snowden deserves a pardon. We all know it \u2014 even if you
        believe he deserves to stand trial, the only option right now is an unfair
        trial on Espionage Act charges in which he'd be blocked from presenting a
        meaningful defense. A pardon from those charges is the only just choice. This
        week, we're joined by Trevor Timm, co-founder of the Freedom Of The Press
        Foundation, and returning guest Parker Higgins to discuss why Edward Snowden
        deserves a pardon, and the campaign to get him one deserves your support."

    name: Pardon Snowden
    author: Techdirt
    content: "Edward Snowden deserves a pardon. We all know it \u2014 even if you
      believe he deserves to stand trial, the only option right now is an unfair trial
      on Espionage Act charges in which he'd be blocked from presenting a meaningful
      defense. A pardon from those charges is the only just choice. This week, we're
      joined by Trevor Timm, co-founder of the Freedom Of The Press Foundation, and
      returning guest Parker Higgins to discuss why Edward Snowden deserves a pardon,
      and the campaign to get him one deserves your support."

        hit from the world of augmented reality \u2014 a technology people have been
        expecting would transform gaming for years. That leaves a big question, though:
        is its popularity a sign of the future for AR, or is the game an isolated
        phenomenon that owes more to the popularity of its brand? This week, we discuss
        what we can learn from Pok\xE9mon Go, and whether we can truly learn anything
        at all."

      author: Techdirt
      content: Algorithms have become a powerful force in the world, but for all the
        impressive good they do, they sometimes show some worrying tendencies. Algorithms
        that discriminate are a problem that nobody's found a solution for yet. This
        week, we discuss why some algorithms appear to be racist, and whether there's
        anything that can be done about it.

      author: Techdirt
      content: It should surprise nobody that the FBI is seeking even broader digital
        surveillance powers by changing the warrant requirements and expanding the
        power of national security letters. If you're a regular Techdirt reader, it
        also won't surprise you to learn that Senator Ron Wyden is working hard to
        hold the line against this kind of expansion. This week, we're joined by Senator
        Wyden to discuss what the FBI is up to and what the public needs to know about
        it.

      author: Techdirt
      content: Net neutrality has a long and complicated history, and despite some
        recent victories, that story is far from over. This week, Mike is joined by
        resident broadband expert Karl Bode to discuss what's next for net neutrality,
        and what we need to do to fight for it.

      name: The Link Between Credit And Surveillance
      author: Techdirt
      content: Both surveillance and the digitization of money are heavily-discussed
        topics, but the intersection between the two often goes overlooked. Historically,
        credit agencies have been trailblazers in the world of surveillance, and today
        we face the fact that the government can use payment providers and other financial
        tools as a means of enforcing its wishes. On this week's episode, we're joined
        by lawyer and writer Sarah Jeong, who recently wrote a four-part series on
        the subject, to discuss the past and future of credit, money, surveillance
        and the way they work together.

        fight between Oracle and Google over whether Google's use of the Java APIs
        in Android constituted copyright infringement, or whether it was fair use.  In
        the end, the jury went with fair use.  Reporter Sarah Jeong watched the entire
        trial from the courtroom and joins us on the Techdirt podcast this week to
        discuss both the legal details and the various oddities of this particular
        trial.

      content: Last week we were joined by Justin Peters, author of the new book The
        Idealist all about Aaron Swartz, free culture and digital activism. The first
        half of the discussion focused on that broader context, and this week we continue
        with a closer look at Aaron himself.

      author: Techdirt
      content: Back in March, Mike moderated a panel at RightsCon on the subject of
        intermediary liability and the delicate balancing act that platform providers
        have to play on that front, with lawyers from Meetup, Change.org, and Medium.
        This week, in lieu of a regular podcast episode we've got a recording of that
        discussion, which delves deeply into some of the difficult choices companies
        like this have to make.

      author: Techdirt
      content: I don't think I need to reiterate how important the battle over the
        future of encryption is. It's not new, but rather the latest clash in a fight
        that has been raging for years, and the high-profile example of the San Bernardino
        attacker's iPhone has cast a spotlight on it. This week, we're joined by longtime
        Techdirt friend Marvin Ammori to dig into the details of this issue, its potential
        consequences, and its context in the history of encryption.

      content: "Anyone even remotely interested in free culture, the internet and
        copyright surely knows the name Aaron Swartz \u2014 but only some truly understand
        what made him tick, and why he was considered so special and important in
        that world. This week and next, we're joined by Justin Peters, author of The
        Idealist, a new book that takes a close look at Aaron himself as well as the
        internet culture that gave rise to his attitudes and activism, which is the
        focus of this first half of the discussion."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "Anyone who reads Techdirt knows our opinion on encryption: stronger
        is better, and giving the government (or anyone else) a back door is a dangerous
        idea. We've decried a lot of the stupid arguments that we've heard in favor
        of back doors \u2014 usually coming from technologically clueless politicians
        and law enforcement officers \u2014 but that doesn't mean we aren't open to
        considering some smart ones. This week, we've invited Albert Wenger (who you
        may recall from a discussion about basic income way back in Episode 16) to
        share his pro-backdoor position and engage in some friendly debate."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "In a world defined by borders for thousands of years, the global nature
        of the internet has caused all sorts of confusion and absurdity. Geographically
        restricted content, fuzzily defined jurisdictions, libel tourism \u2014 these
        are all symptoms of a border-filled world coming to terms with a borderless
        network. Since attempts to carve up the internet along geographical lines
        aren't likely to stop anytime soon, this week we ask the question: are such
        attempts futile, and could online borders really serve any purpose to begin
        with?"

      author: Techdirt
      content: "The battle for net neutrality seemed like it was over \u2014 but the
        regulations left a loophole open. Unsurprisingly, ISPs quickly started exploiting
        it, offering \"zero rating\" services to do an end-run around true net neutrality.
        Last week's guest Marvin Ammori joins us again this week, to discuss the true
        and imperfect state of net neutrality, and the many games internet providers
        play."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "We all know the patent system is riddled with problems, and badly
        in need of reform. But reform comes slow \u2014 really, really slow. So some
        tech companies have been doing what they do best: innovate. They are finding
        ways to get around the biggest problems of the patent system without waiting
        on go-nowhere legislative reform efforts. This week we're joined by Julie
        Samuels, President of the Board at Engine, to discuss the innovation-based
        approach to navigating the patent system and changing patent culture."

      author: Techdirt
      content: The "gig economy" of on-demand peer-to-peer services like Uber has
        been gaining traction, but not every company is faring so well. In some areas,
        the rush of entrants has outstripped demand and left on-demand providers struggling
        to stay afloat. This week we discuss what happens when there's not enough
        demand for an on-demand platform, and what it might mean for the sector as
        a whole.

    name: Should Internet Companies Sway Elections?
    author: Techdirt
    content: 'Recently, some Facebook staffers raised an interesting question: should
      the social media giant employ its significant power to stem the rise of Donald
      Trump? This week, we discuss that notion and the broader question: should the
      internet companies that influence so many aspects of our communication and information
      gathering pursue political goals?'

        considered by the EU is full of extremely dangerous ideas, from mandated filters

      author: Techdirt
      content: The latest entrant on the decentralized transportation scene is the
        suddenly-ubiquitous electric scooters that are taking over San Francisco and
        other cities. Their appearance has triggered the inevitable controversy, with
        some saying they are ruining cities while others laud their convenience for
        urbanites. And, of course, a regulatory battle wasn't far behind. On this
        week's episode, we discuss the e-scooter trend and its many pros and cons.

        Summit in Portland, Oregon, he and I discuss my continual messing up of people&#8217;s
        Indieweb experience, little things I&#8217;ve hidden in plugins, web-signin
        vs IndieAuth, etc. We&#8217;re both looking forward to seeing those of you
        who can join us in Portland.

      author: Techdirt
      content: "Recently, Valve sent waves through the PC gaming world by announcing
        an upcoming policy change for its Steam platform: it will no longer enforce
        specific content rules and will allow all games as long as they aren't illegal
        or \"straight-up trolling\". Though it's not exactly clear what this means,
        the reaction from the gaming press has been largely negative, and it's hard
        to say how the new policy will be implemented \u2014 so this week myself,
        Tim Geigner and Cathy Gellis join the podcast to discuss just what's going
        to happen on the biggest platform for PC games."

      content: "Ben & David break down Jet.com\u2019s meteoric rise, culminating in
        Walmart\u2019s blockbuster $3B+ acquisition of the company just two years
        after its founding. Will we look back on this deal as an \u2018Instagram-like\u2019
        bargain or a \u2018Pets.com'-sized blunder? And most importantly, can *anyone*
        compete with Amazon going forward? We speculate wildly.  Topics covered include:
        \ - Community spotlight: Nowdue, a super fast invoicing platform for teams
        on Slack. Invoice like it\u2019s the future! This looks very cool. - Jet\u2019s
        deep origins in Founder & CEO Marc Lore\u2019s first two companies, The Pit
        and Quidsi (aka, diapers.com) - Lore\u2019s chance run-in with Jeff Bezos
        at a school picnic in Seattle in the early 2000\u2019s - Amazon's dramatic
        acquisition of Quidsi in 2010, including Bezos\u2019 admonition to Amazon
        corp dev to keep Quidsi from being bought by Walmart under any circumstances
        (covered well in The Everything Store) - Lore\u2019s less-than-favorable opinion
        of Amazon's culture - Lore's vision of Jet as an \u2018online Costco\u2019
        that can directly with Amazon on price by selling goods to a \u201Chuge middle-class
        of people\" at effectively zero margin, and make profit on membership fees
        - Jet\u2019s huge, pre-launch fundraising rounds, and subsequent massively
        promoted public launch in July 2015 - Jet\u2019s pivot in October 2015 to
        drop the membership model (their only profit engine), and subsequent massive
        growth (but also accompanying massive losses) - 'Admitting defeat\u201D to
        Amazon in July 2016? Immediately followed by the blockbuster $3B+ Walmart
        acquisition announcement - Is e-commerce really a winner-take-all business
        and will Amazon just take over the world? Featuring liberal citations (again)
        of Ben Thompson's Aggregation Theory and the importance of customer experience.
        - Is there any path for Walmart & Jet to compete effectively with Amazon?
        Is Marc Lore Walmart\u2019s only hope? - Fantastic interview with Tim Cook
        discussing (among other things) the massive amount of growth still left in
        the internet  Followups:  - Lucasfilm: Star Wars Rouge One trailer drops!
        Featuring a strong female protagonist!  New section: Hot Takes! (thank you
        @cteitzel on Slack for the idea)  - Verizon/AOL acquires Yahoo! - Lyft reportedly
        turns down acquisition offer from GM - Microsoft acquires Beam - Randstad
        acquires Monster.com  The Carve Out  - Ben: Michael Mauboussin\u2019s Talk
        at Google and Reflections on the Ten Attributes of Great Investors after thirty
        years of honing his craft - David: Strava, the fantastic social fitness-tracking
        app"

      name: Are Tech And Journalism Att Odds With Each Other?
      author: Techdirt
      content: Between Elon Musk's proposal for a website ranking the credibility
        of journalists and Tim Draper blaming the collapse of Theranos on the press
        (not to mention Peter Thiel's attack on Gawker), it feels like there's a war
        brewing between Silicon Valley and journalism. Though the press has some major
        problems, it really seems like tech entrepreneurs are misunderstanding how
        it works and proposing some dangerous ideas. This week, we discuss the tensions
        between tech and journalism, and what will come from the proposals to address
        it.

        podcast. As you know, I started by reaching out to Netscape folks and Rosanne
        was the head of communications for that very first dotcom company. She saw
        it all, she can give us her take on both the engineering side and the management
        side, since she was uniquely able to observe both. Rosanne and I were recently
        on a documentary series currently airing on A&amp;E in the US, The Untold
        Story of the 90s. So, I reached out, and we recoded this fantastic extended
        interview about all things Netscape and about the very birth of the Internet
        Era.&nbsp;\r\n      "

        that we would go on for another hundred episodes - very few podcasts manage
        to go that long week after week, let alone with this amount of versatility
        and fun we're having with it. But we did, and we couldn't be happier about
        it, and we thank you for your continued support which keeps us going! Here's
        us hoping for 300 in 2020?\r\n\r\nToday's release contains:\r\n- 3 mixes including
        the finest demo and compo tracks from 2014\r\n- 1 bonus mix of the best demo

      content: "Episode #202 \u2013 Insert Disk 2 Special - Instant Remedy (in collaboration
        with 010101 Music)\r\n\r\nSwedish remixing legend Martin Noriander Instant
        Remedy is finally back with a brand-new album - \"Insert Disk 2\" celebrates
        the 30th anniversary of the Amiga brand with a fine selection of arranged
        game and demoscene tracks from the 16-bit era. Episode #202 features tracks
        from this new album, its predecessor, as well as original game music composed
        by Instant Remedy.\r\n\r\nSays Martin: \"When the internet was still young,
        me and a few classmates discovered the HVSC and SIDPLay. All of a sudden it
        was possible to listen to all those great tunes - without the hassle of setting
        up a real C64 to load the games! However, I wanted to add something to the
        SID music to make it sound fuller and suitable for listening on a stereo system.
        So I started adding some drums, bass and other stuff, just for fun. At first,
        I played these tracks for friends only. Remixing game music was not as common
        back then as it is today. They really liked what I had done, so I decided
        to submit MP3s to some sites... and so my remixes started to spread.\"\r\n\r\nMixed
        by Jegougou, logo by KF, thank you to Instant Remedy, Jan Zottmann and Bobic"

    content: "Episode #200c - 2014 In The Mix\r\nFive years ago we crossed our fingers
      that we would go on for another hundred episodes - very few podcasts manage
      to go that long week after week, let alone with this amount of versatility and
      fun we're having with it. But we did, and we couldn't be happier about it, and
      we thank you for your continued support which keeps us going! Here's us hoping
      for 300 in 2020?\r\n\r\nToday's release contains:\r\n- 3 mixes including the
      finest demo and compo tracks from 2014\r\n- 1 bonus mix of the best demo tracks
      from 2009\r\n\r\nThis is episode #200c - Best Compotracks from 2014 - Part 2.\r\n\r\nBitJam
      Podcast - We Are Unstoppable!\r\n\r\nMixed and compiled by Salinga, logo #200
      by KF, text by Gargaj\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nALiEN, Bobic, CONS, Cristian, Jegougou,
      KF, Salinga, Vincenzo"

        so terrible I just had to try again.  This one''s about one of my favorite

        Your Amateur Moment. I''ve tried to take a (minor) sour moment and turn it
        into something positive. I also got to give some thoughts on some generalized
        criticisms that are usually subtweeted in my direction, although how much
        this episode moves the needle, I''ll likely never know.  The presentation,
        by the way, was a lot of fun and I got to meet some really great folks who
        I''d never had the chance to meet. I found out about some long-memory examples
        held up in in the professional spheres, and I hope to research those to have
        what other lessons could have learned. Also, lunch was amazing and someone
        handed me a stack of hard drives.  Also, now you know why "Rank Amateur" is
        in my twitter bio!'

      author: ABC Radio National
      content: For 50 years air conditioning in commercial buildings has been set
        using the Standard 55 guidelines. But many workplaces aren't staffed solely
        with 40-year-old men dressed in 60s business suits, and that's left women
        out in the cold, as Dr Karl Kruszelnicki argues.

        when you try to take it through an airport X-ray scanner. It's also very resistant

      author: ABC Radio National
      content: Many of us access the internet, and the world wide web, via wi-fi.
        Wi-fi lets us into a fabulous world of shared knowledge and social interaction.
        On the flip side, it seems that wi-fi can look at us, and perhaps even spy
        on us. It can even recognize moving humans on the other side of a wall. And
        this happens by examining not the content of the wi-fi signal, but its strength
        and timing.

      name: 174. Bringing the NYTimes and MSNBC Online With Lisa Napoli
      author: internethistorypodcast@gmail.com (Brian McCullough @brianmcc)
      content: "Lisa Napoli got a job straight out of college at CNN in its earliest
        days, which is a crazy startup story in it\u2019s own right. But then she
        worked for a time at Delphi, which was an early online service and competitor
        to AOL and Prodigy that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve covered much here before.
        And then she helped bring the NYTimes online with CyberTimes, which, as she
        said, is forgotten to history even by the New York Times. Then on to MSNBC,
        a crazy hybrid tech and media startup that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve discussed
        much either. There\u2019s just so many great stories here. Please enjoy this
        conversation with Lisa Napoli.\r\n      "

      content: "Today, we're going to continue our occasional project of getting oral
        histories and personal anecdotes about how, exactly, the Internet and the
        web came to various places around the world. On this episode we're going to
        look at how the Internet came to\u2014and is still in the process of coming
        to\u2014Pakistan. Imran Haider is a listener to the show, works in the tech
        industry, and analyzes the south asian tech scene at his blog, arkito.co.
        Today, he tells us how the digital revolution came to Pakistan, how it's still
        in the process of rolling out, what that has meant for Pakistani society and
        what the startup and tech scene IS in Pakistan. My thanks to Imran Haider
        for being a longtime listener to this show, and for being willing to contribute
        to the project, and please, check him out at arkito.co... it's Ben Thompson
        level analysis of the tech scene in the sub continent.\r\n      "

      content: "Digg was the earliest high flying startup in early social media. But
        then, other startups started to steal the limelight. Digg tried to keep up
        by launching Digg version 4. And\u2026 users hate it. Many people feel that
        the reason Reddit is Reddit today is because the Digg community fled their
        en-masse. Digg Version 4 has become legendary as a redesign so disruptive
        it can kill a company. So, what\u2019s the real story? Today, we talk to Will
        Larson, who was a young engineer working on the launch of Digg version "

        me for a late night(for me at least) discussion of Gutenberg, the new WordPress
        editor, and the usual project talk. I felt I was a bit off due the lateness
        of the hour, but I still enjoyed the conversation.

      content: "I said in the book, I think TheGlobe.com was the quintessential dot-com
        company. We spoke to one of the cofounders previously, Todd Krizelman. Todd
        was great, but he was time constrained and he didn\u2019t quite get as personal
        about the story as I would have hoped. Well, I finally got to talk to the
        other founder of TheGlobe, Stephan Paternot. And Stephan was\u2026 AMAZING.
        He shared the whole story, the whole wild ride, from a historical angle, from
        a business angle, from an entrepreneurial angle and also, from a very personal
        angle. THIS the dot-com era story I\u2019ve been looking for for years. It\u2019s
        also the story of probably the most important pioneer of social media before
        there was even a term for such a thing. And by the way\u2026 that TV Show
        that just came out on NAT GEO, Valley of the Boom? THIS IS THAT STORY. Stephan
        just re-released his book, A Very Public Offering: The Story of theglobe.com

      name: Free Speech Disorder, With Mike Godwin
      author: Techdirt
      content: Last week, we published a series of posts by Mike Godwin looking at
        Our Bipolar Free Speech Disorder And How To Fix It (check out part one, part
        two, and part three). But with a topic like this, there's always more to dig
        into, so this week we've got Mike Godwin joining the podcast to take a closer
        look at his ideas about free speech in the digital era.

      content: "A few weeks ago, we featured a panel discussion with Mike and others
        at the Lincoln Network's Reboot conference on the podcast. This week we're
        doing something a little different and featuring another panel discussion
        from that conference, but one in which Mike wasn't involved. Instead, it's
        an interesting \u2014 and at times contentious \u2014 debate about one big
        question: do the big tech firms need to be broken up?"

      content: By now, there's a good chance you've received an invitation to join
        Initiative Q, and also a good chance that you took one look at it and thought
        "wow, this seems extremely sketchy." And indeed, there's little reason (other
        than hopefulness) to see the strange new proposed payment system as anything
        but a pyramid scheme. But it's got people talking, thanks in no small part
        to its viral marketing scheme, so this week's episode is all about trying
        to figure out just what Initiative Q really is.

      Bipolar Free Speech Disorder And How To Fix It (check out part one, part two,
      and part three). But with a topic like this, there's always more to dig into,

      author: Techdirt
      content: As artificial intelligence technology marches onwards, it's raising
        a lot of complicated questions about free speech, privacy, and important rights.
        One person who's been thinking a lot about these questions is David Kaye,
        the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to
        freedom of opinion and expression, who recently published a thorough report
        [pdf] on the subject. This week, David joins us on the podcast to discuss
        artificial intelligence and its implications for human rights.

    name: AI, Free Speech & Human Rights
    author: Techdirt
    content: As artificial intelligence technology marches onwards, it's raising a
      lot of complicated questions about free speech, privacy, and important rights.
      One person who's been thinking a lot about these questions is David Kaye, the
      UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom
      of opinion and expression, who recently published a thorough report [pdf] on
      the subject. This week, David joins us on the podcast to discuss artificial
      intelligence and its implications for human rights.

      content: Ok, part 2 of the Stephan Paternot mega-episode right now. This is
        where we get into the meat of it, the good stuff, the whole crazy roller coaster
        ride of being the hottest startup of the dotcom era. And I was going to make
        this the last episode, but as I was editing this, I realized that after we
        get done with this story, Stephan talks a lot about what happens after...
        what happens after you've been on a crazy ride like this. How you have to
        reinvent yourself, and your life, and your career. He said so many interesting
        things about that, that for the first time ever, we're going to do a part
        3, coming in two weeks, to talk about the reinvention.

      content: There has long been anxiety around the "permanent record" of the internet,
        and recent public shamings based on old tweets have brought that fear to the
        forefront for many people. But the mass deletion of old tweets also means
        throwing out huge amounts of potentially valuable information. Is there a
        technological solution? A cultural one? This week, we're joined by returning
        guests Cathy Gellis and Parker Higgins to discuss a proposal for fixing the
        problem without sacrificing the permanent record.

      content: "One thing we've talked about for a long time at Techdirt is the importance
        communities for media outlets, including our own. These days, it feels like
        a lot of media companies are giving up on this work altogether and outsourcing
        it to social media platforms \u2014 but that means foregoing some of the most
        powerful aspects of the internet. This week, we're joined by Josh Millard,
        who recently took over MetaFilter, to talk about building online communities
        and not relying on Facebook."

        it, so this week we've got a conversation with UCLA professor Neil Netanel,

      author: Techdirt
      content: "Is the way companies are currently structured and operated conducive
        to long-term innovation? It's a tough question, but there are plenty of reasons
        to consider that short-term profit incentives might be getting in the way
        of better overall innovation strategies \u2014 and lots of possibilities for
        how we might rethink companies to change this. This week, the regular crew
        of Mike, Hersh and Dennis discuss how this problem could be addressed, and
        whether there's truly a problem at all."

      author: Techdirt
      content: One of the most dangerous aspects of SOPA and other copyright proposals
        is the idea of moving enforcement and liability further down the stack of
        technology that powers the internet, even all the way to the DNS system. Although
        SOPA's DNS-blocking proposals were heavily criticized and the bill ultimately
        defeated, the idea of deep-level copyright enforcement has lived on and been
        implemented without changes to the law. This week our returning guest, law
        professor Annemarie Bridy, discusses how private agreements have quietly recreated
        some of the worst aspects of SOPA.

      content: Part three of our epic conversation with Stephan Paternot. Here's what
        happens when you've been through the wringer. When you've been to the top
        of the rollercoaster and also down to the bottom. Here's how you take stock
        of your life, how you reinvent yourself, re-find you entrepreneurial spirit...
        I feel like there are so many lessons in these three episodes. Lessons for
        entrepreneurs today. Lesson for... I dunno. People in the crypto space? My
        thanks to Stephan Paternot for an insanely great conversation.&nbsp;

    author: Brian McCullough
    content: Part three of our epic conversation with Stephan Paternot. Here's what
      happens when you've been through the wringer. When you've been to the top of
      the rollercoaster and also down to the bottom. Here's how you take stock of
      your life, how you reinvent yourself, re-find you entrepreneurial spirit---
      I feel like there are so many lessons in these three episodes. Lessons for entrepreneurs
      today. Lesson for--- I dunno. People in the crypto space? My thanks to Stephan
      Paternot for an insanely great conversation.&nbsp;

        time that new works have actually entered the public domain in the US! The

        this week we're joined by IA's Lila Bailey and CC's Timothy Vollmer to talk
        about that event and the exciting possibilities of a re-opened public domain.

        How much have we talked about disruption and piracy and filesharing and all

        since the web went mainstream. We talk about the Napster era, we talk about
        how much of an influence the adult industry had on digital law, we talk about

        law stuff like GDPR."

      content: "Podcast #479: Becoming a Digital Minimalist\r\n\r\nPracticing minimalism
        with your possessions has been a trend for the past decade, and it can be
        a worthy practice, as long as you use it as a means to greater efficacy outside
        your personal domain, rather than just an end in itself.\r\n\r\nBut there\u2019s
        arguably a minimalism practice that\u2019s even more effective in achieving
        that greater efficacy: digital minimalism.\r\n\r\nMy guest has written the
        definitive guide to the philosophy and tactics behind digital minimalism.
        His name is Cal Newport and this is his third visit to the AoM Podcast. We\u2019ve
        had him on the show previously to discuss his books So Good They Can\u2019t
        Ignore You and Deep Work. Today, we discuss his latest book, Digital Minimalism:
        Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World.\r\n\r\nWe begin our conversation
        discussing why digital tech feels so addicting, why Steve Jobs didn\u2019t
        originally intend for the iPhone to become something we check all the time,
        and why the common tips for reducing your smartphone use don\u2019t work and
        you need to implement more nuclear solutions instead. We then discuss the
        surprising lesson the Amish can teach you about being intentional about technology,
        how cleaning up your digital life is like decluttering your house, and why
        he recommends a 30-day tech fast to evaluate what tech you want to let back
        into your life. Cal then makes an argument for why you should see social media
        like training wheels for navigating the web, how to take those wheels off,
        and why you should own your own domain address. We end our conversation exploring
        what you should do in the free time you open up once your digital distractions
        are tamed, and the advanced techniques you can use to take the practice of
        digital minimalism to the next level.\r\n\r\nI think you\u2019ll find this
        a tremendously interesting and important show.\r\n\r\nShow Highlights:\r\nThe
        problems people are having with their smartphone and social media habits \r\nHow
        connecting online isn\u2019t the same as connecting in \u201Creal\u201D life
        \ \r\nSteve Jobs original vision for the iPhone \r\nWhen, why, and how did
        apps become so irresistible?\r\nWhy the \u201Clike\u201D button has changed
        the entire ecosystem of the internet (and why to stop!)\r\nHow your brain
        reacts to social media feedback (and how it\u2019s been hijacked)\r\nWhy modest
        tips and \u201Chacks\u201D for curbing our phone use don\u2019t work all that
        well\r\nWhy Cal advocates for a bigger fix \r\nCal\u2019s 3 principles of
        \u201Cdigital minimalism\u201D\r\nWhat Thoreau\u2019s experiment at Walden
        Pond can teach us about clutter (even of the digital variety)\r\nWhy the costs
        of social media need to be weighed against their benefits \r\nOptimizing social
        media so that it works for you rather than against you \r\nWhat the Amish
        can teach us about adopting new technologies \r\nDecluttering your digital
        life \r\nWhat 30 days off of modern internet tech does for your life and brain\r\nReintroducing
        social media into your life after decluttering\r\nWhy you should keep strict

      content: "We\u2019ve had a couple of people come on here to discuss how the
        New York Times got online, but the spiritual yin to their yang is the Wall
        Street Journal and we haven\u2019t done enough to explore their path to embracing
        the internet. It\u2019s worth doing that because they embraced a different
        model from basically day one. Almost alone among the web media pioneers, the
        Journal went the subscription route. So, we\u2019re going to talk to Rich
        Jaroslovksy, who headed the team that brought the Journal online, to see why
        they went that route, to learn about the path to the web and much more."

      author: []
      content: "Some people believe that decentralization is the inevitable future
        of the web. They believe that internet users will start to demand more privacy
        and authenticity of information online, and that they\u2019ll look to decentralized
        platforms to get those things. But would decentralization be as utopian as
        advocates say it could be?\r\n\r\nHost Manoush Zomorodi speaks to Eugen Rochko
        of Mastodon, an ad-free alternative to Twitter; Justin Hunter of Graphite
        docs, a decentralized alternative to GoogleDocs; Maria Bustillos who hopes
        to help eliminate fake news online through the Blockchain; David Irvine, the
        co-founder of MaidSafe who plans to make the centralized internet as we know
        it redundant; and Tom Simonite of WIRED, who comments on both the promise
        and also the pitfalls of decentralization.\r\n\r\nhttps://irlpodcast.org/season4/episode6/"

        For some reason, CheapShow asked a YouTube Retro Gamer and Digitiser The Show co-host to come on the podcast. And for some reason, she said yes. So, as a result, this is that episode! Please welcome Octav1ous Kitten to the show!

        Paul and Eli welcome her to the CheapShow Family in the only way they know how, by giving her dodgy presents, causing her to choke on milky powder, constantly getting her name wrong, offering her a suspicious Columbian import, dealing with Eli's wrath and literally getting her to split her trousers with laughter. No one deserves that.

        Oh and yes, there is also another Winkie update! The Winkie Rabbit hole gets deeper by the week... Somehow.

      Hired For Doing The Wrong Thing, Scripting and Scripting Languages, The Boundaries
      of Scripting, DUMPTRUCK, Heimdall, Heimdall''s Secret, A Memorial Moment with

      content: |
        The Internet (at least in the US) is at a crossroads as the FCC is considering rolling back the net neutrality regulations it adopted in 2015.  If net neutrality is abolished, the Internet could shift from an essential service that all consumers can access to a product that can be packaged and sold to the highest bidders. Get to know the potential winners and losers on both sides of the issue.

      content: "Our online life is real life. We walk, talk, work, LOL and even love
        on the Internet \u2013 but we don\u2019t always treat it like real life. Host
        Veronica Belmont explores this disconnect with stories from the wilds of the
        Web \u2013 and gets to the bottom of online issues that affect us all. Whether
        it\u2019s privacy breaches, closed platforms, hacking, fake news, or cyber
        bullying, we the people have the power to change the course of the Internet,
        keeping it healthy, weird, and wonderful for everyone.\n"

      content: "In our final episode of season 1, we break from our usual format to
        host a big conversation. Recent events like the Charlottesville, VA rally
        have revealed the Internet\u2019s role in helping spread IRL threats and violence.
        Leaders in the tech world have represented varying positions on both protecting
        free speech and also reducing hate speech online.  Should tech companies regulate
        who says what on the Internet? Brandi Collins of Color of Change, Anil Dash
        of Fog Creek Software and Jillian York of the Electronic Frontier Foundation
        address this question and more with Veronica Belmont.\n"

      In Season 3 of IRL, we're exploring the bargains we make online every day, and how we might approach striking better deals with the powers that be. You'll find out what happened when the U.S. Army got into the video game business, what it's like to be a professional flirter on Tinder (for real), and how a super cute pig transformed a person's life one Instagram post at a time. Episode 1 launches July 2nd. Subscribe via Apple podcasts or Spotify, or wherever you get your ear candy.

        of the \"Je Suis Auto\" film is Juliana Neuhuber (https://www.juliananeuhuber.com/)
        and Johannes is co-director but mostly in the role of main actor and writer.
        Johannes (and I and others) had ideas but Juliana was the final word on set.

      content: 'Sometimes people ask us why we write so much about the police on Techdirt.
        Though our coverage has grown somewhat beyond the boundaries of incidents
        directly involving technology, the reality is that the problems with law enforcement
        persistently intersect with the same technological and legal issues we''ve
        always discussed here. But this week the focus is squarely on cops and technology:
        Mike is joined by Matt Stroud, author of the new book Thin Blue Lie, as well
        as our own Tim Cushing, to talk about the failure of high-tech policing.'

      name: Your Password is the Worst
      author: Mozilla
      content: "Look, we agree with you: passwords are the worst. But you know what
        else is the worst? Someone hacking your account, or big security breaches
        that expose your email, your credit card information, your government-issued
        identification number, and more. We should hold companies accountable for
        better security, but we also need to hold ourselves accountable for having
        good password hygiene. So let's tackle this once and for all. Hear from Buzzfeed's
        Mat Honan, who endured a brutal hack a few years ago when hackers exploited
        password-recovery tools; Mark Wilson from Fast Company, who wants to ban passwords
        altogether (though admits it's not the best idea); Masha Sedova of Elevate
        Security who says that, yes, security companies have failed us \u2013 but
        we have to use passwords anyway; and Matt Davey of 1Password, who offers a
        solution that Mozilla can get behind: use a password manager. A simple, game-changing
        tool that will help you take back control of your accounts, and secure yourself
        as best as you can.\n\nIRL is an original podcast from Mozilla. For more on

        to the next, and we try and fail to manage how many things we read at once.

      author: Mozilla
      content: "All the things we love on the internet \u2014 from websites that give
        us information to services that connect us \u2014 are made stronger when their
        creators come with different points of view.  With this in mind, we asked
        ourselves and our guests: \"What would the internet look like if it was built
        by mostly women?\"\n\nWitchsy founders Kate Dwyer and Penelope Gazin start
        us off with a story about the stunt they had to pull to get their site launched
        \u2014 and counter the sexist attitudes they fought against along the way.
        Brenda Darden Wilkerson recalls her life in tech in the 80s and 90s and shares
        her experience leading AnitaB.org, an organization striving to get more women
        hired in tech. Coraline Ada Ehmke created the Contributor Covenant, a voluntary
        code of conduct being increasingly adopted by the open source community. She
        explains why she felt it necessary, and how it's been received; and Mighty
        Networks CEO Gina Bianchini rolls her eyes at being called a \"lady CEO,\"
        and tells us why diversifying the boardroom is great for business and innovation.\n"

      name: Decentralize It
      author: Mozilla
      content: "Some people believe that decentralization is the inevitable future
        of the web. They believe that internet users will start to demand more privacy
        and authenticity of information online and that they\u2019ll look to decentralized
        platforms to get those things. But would decentralization be as utopian as
        advocates say it could be?\n\nHost Manoush Zomorodi  speaks to Eugen Rochko
        of Mastodon, an ad-free alternative to Twitter; Justin Hunter of Graphite
        docs, a decentralized alternative to GoogleDocs; Maria Bustillos who hopes
        to help eliminate fake news online through the Blockchain; David Irvine, the
        co-founder of MaidSafe who plans to make the centralized internet as we know
        it redundant; and Tom Simonite of WIRED, who comments on both the promise
        and also the pitfalls of decentralization.\n\nIRL is an original podcast from

      author: Mozilla
      content: "In her new book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Harvard Business
        School\u2019s Shoshana Zuboff argues that tech companies \u2014 like Google
        and Facebook \u2014 collect so much personal data for profit, that they\u2019re
        changing the fundamentals of our economy and way of life. And now these companies
        are learning to shape our behavior to better serve their business goals. Shoshana
        joins Manoush Zomorodi to explain what this all means for us.\n\nWe then explore
        whether or not it\u2019s time to end our relationship with corporate spies.
        OG advice columnist Dear Abby gives us some tips to start with. We chat with
        philosopher S. Matthew Liao. He asks if we have a moral duty to quit Facebook.
        Alice Marwick explains why most people won\u2019t leave the social network.
        And journalist Nithin Coca tells us what it was like for him to quit both
        Facebook and Google. Spoiler alert: it wasn\u2019t easy, but he has no regrets.\n\nIRL

      name: 192. Hulu's Founding and Digital Design With Dan Maccarone
      author: Brian McCullough
      content: Dan Maccarone is a digital design veteran, websites, products, strategy.
        He's got some amazing stories about the dotcom bubble, about the aftermath,
        and the rise of Web 2.0. He shares some unique design lessons but also, the
        story of the birth of Hulu, which I don't think has really been covered anywhere
        before.

    name: What if women built the internet?
    author: Mozilla
    content: "All the things we love on the internet \u2014 from websites that give
      us information to services that connect us \u2014 are made stronger when their
      creators come with different points of view.  With this in mind, we asked ourselves
      and our guests: \"What would the internet look like if it was built by mostly
      women?\"\n\nWitchsy founders Kate Dwyer and Penelope Gazin start us off with
      a story about the stunt they had to pull to get their site launched \u2014 and
      counter the sexist attitudes they fought against along the way. Brenda Darden
      Wilkerson recalls her life in tech in the 80s and 90s and shares her experience
      leading AnitaB.org, an organization striving to get more women hired in tech.
      Coraline Ada Ehmke created the Contributor Covenant, a voluntary code of conduct
      being increasingly adopted by the open source community. She explains why she
      felt it necessary, and how it's been received; and Mighty Networks CEO Gina
      Bianchini rolls her eyes at being called a \"lady CEO,\" and tells us why diversifying
      the boardroom is great for business and innovation.\n"

        collection program \u2014 the first exposed by Edward Snowden \u2014 Marcy
        joins us on this week's episode to discuss the surveillance state and why

      name: 193. The Home Page Film With Doug Block
      author: Brian McCullough
      content: "20 years ago, the acclaimed documentarian Doug Block released a landmark
        film, Home Page. Doug\u2019s documentary accidentally chronicled the birth
        of blogging, featuring several people we\u2019ve talked to on this very show,
        including Justin Hall. But the documentary also captured a moment in time,
        the web going mainstream, the beginnings of the dotcom bubble, the early days
        of Wired, Hotwired and Suck and also so many of the things I ask people about
        on here regularly. How people learned to live online, to begin to port all
        of modern life over to the digital. Well, Home Page is celebrating its 20th
        anniversary with a re-release, and starting this week, you can watch it yourself
        everywhere films are gettable, including iTunes. Today we speak to Doug Block
        about this amazing movie that I think is one of the best historical records
        of the era we have been interrogating for nearly 5 years on this podcast.
        Go watch Home Page yourself, and check out The D-word, Doug\u2019s community
        for documentarians, at D-word.com."

      author: Brian McCullough
      content: Today we continue my efforts to preserve the history of the ISP industry.
        Today it feels like the Internet is simply all around us all the time, but
        there are amazing entrepreneurial stories about how that crucial infrastructure
        was laid. Today we talk to Sonic founder Dane Jasper, who can not only give
        us the history of the industry, but the present day as well, as Sonic is still
        a thriving and important independent ISP.

      author: Techdirt
      content: Of all the laws we discuss here at Techdirt, probably none comes up
        as often or in relation to as many things as Section 230 of the Communications
        Decency Act. It's not an exaggeration to describe it the way Professor Jeff
        Kosseff does in the title of his new book, The Twenty-Six Words That Created
        The Internet, offering a detailed history of this vital piece of law. This
        week, Jeff joins us on the podcast for an in-depth discussion about where
        Section 230 came from, and where it's going.

      The Infocom .ZIP File, A Release, Stu Galley, Github, The Clones and Branches,
      Steve and Kevin have a chat. An episode about the release of the Infocom Source
      Code on Github. It's currently available on the HistoricalSource collection
      there:  https://github.com/historicalsource\_ The ZIL Language is now having
      a little renaissance and I hope to see some actual games come out of it. Until
      then, I'm not kidding - type in the name of any Infocom game and you can probably
      be playing it within seconds. I recommend a walk through the document Steve
      Meretzky wrote at Infocom to explain the ZIL source code here:  https://archive.org/details/Learning_ZIL_Steven_Eric_Meretzky_1995\_
      Here's the video of the chat with Steve and Kevin:  https://www.twitch.tv/videos/416801231\_"

    name: The Sorting Episode
    author: Jason Scott
    content: 'The Sorting Episode: A Life of Sorting, File Classifications, My Subdirectories,
      The Storage Unit, Photos and Movies and Boxes and Personal, The Actual Question,
      What the Actual Answer Might Be, An Empty Container. Plus: An Offer to Help
      Me Sort. A lot of people asked me to speak about my sorting method - I hope
      it''s simple and straightforward how I approach things. I use this everywhere,
      and if I wanted to be a very bearded Marie Kondo, this is how I''d start to
      explain myself. Like all the other times I invite people into projects, the
      project mentioned at the end is going to be continual and the offer won''t expire.
      Thanks for considering some help.'
