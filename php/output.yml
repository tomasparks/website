          content: "Today we're going to go back to take a look at early journalism
            on the web. Karl Mattson helped launched one of the first political news
            websites, ElectionLine. He helped cover the 1996 election when covering
            an election on the web was a completely new thing. He then moved to AOL,
            helped run their news channels and has some amazing historical details
            about he era, especially the Clinton intern scandal.\r\n      "

            podcast. As you know, I started by reaching out to Netscape folks and
            Rosanne was the head of communications for that very first dotcom company.
            She saw it all, she can give us her take on both the engineering side
            and the management side, since she was uniquely able to observe both.
            Rosanne and I were recently on a documentary series currently airing on
            A&amp;E in the US, The Untold Story of the 90s. So, I reached out, and
            we recoded this fantastic extended interview about all things Netscape
            and about the very birth of the Internet Era.&nbsp;\r\n      "

          name: Are Tech And Journalism Att Odds With Each Other?
          author: Techdirt
          content: Between Elon Musk's proposal for a website ranking the credibility
            of journalists and Tim Draper blaming the collapse of Theranos on the
            press (not to mention Peter Thiel's attack on Gawker), it feels like there's
            a war brewing between Silicon Valley and journalism. Though the press
            has some major problems, it really seems like tech entrepreneurs are misunderstanding
            how it works and proposing some dangerous ideas. This week, we discuss
            the tensions between tech and journalism, and what will come from the

          content: Back in March, Mike moderated a panel at RightsCon on the subject
            of intermediary liability and the delicate balancing act that platform
            providers have to play on that front, with lawyers from Meetup, Change.org,
            and Medium. This week, in lieu of a regular podcast episode we've got
            a recording of that discussion, which delves deeply into some of the difficult
            choices companies like this have to make.

          content: "The battle for net neutrality seemed like it was over \u2014 but
            the regulations left a loophole open. Unsurprisingly, ISPs quickly started
            exploiting it, offering \"zero rating\" services to do an end-run around
            true net neutrality. Last week's guest Marvin Ammori joins us again this
            week, to discuss the true and imperfect state of net neutrality, and the
            many games internet providers play."

          content: The "gig economy" of on-demand peer-to-peer services like Uber
            has been gaining traction, but not every company is faring so well. In
            some areas, the rush of entrants has outstripped demand and left on-demand
            providers struggling to stay afloat. This week we discuss what happens
            when there's not enough demand for an on-demand platform, and what it
            might mean for the sector as a whole.

            is better, and giving the government (or anyone else) a back door is a
            dangerous idea. We've decried a lot of the stupid arguments that we've
            heard in favor of back doors \u2014 usually coming from technologically
            clueless politicians and law enforcement officers \u2014 but that doesn't
            mean we aren't open to considering some smart ones. This week, we've invited
            Albert Wenger (who you may recall from a discussion about basic income
            way back in Episode 16) to share his pro-backdoor position and engage
            in some friendly debate."

            nature of the internet has caused all sorts of confusion and absurdity.
            Geographically restricted content, fuzzily defined jurisdictions, libel
            tourism \u2014 these are all symptoms of a border-filled world coming
            to terms with a borderless network. Since attempts to carve up the internet
            along geographical lines aren't likely to stop anytime soon, this week
            we ask the question: are such attempts futile, and could online borders
            really serve any purpose to begin with?"

            the future of encryption is. It's not new, but rather the latest clash
            in a fight that has been raging for years, and the high-profile example
            of the San Bernardino attacker's iPhone has cast a spotlight on it. This
            week, we're joined by longtime Techdirt friend Marvin Ammori to dig into
            the details of this issue, its potential consequences, and its context
            in the history of encryption.

            some tech companies have been doing what they do best: innovate. They
            are finding ways to get around the biggest problems of the patent system
            without waiting on go-nowhere legislative reform efforts. This week we're
            joined by Julie Samuels, President of the Board at Engine, to discuss
            the innovation-based approach to navigating the patent system and changing
            patent culture."

          author: Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal
          content: "Ben & David break down Jet.com\u2019s meteoric rise, culminating
            in Walmart\u2019s blockbuster $3B+ acquisition of the company just two
            years after its founding. Will we look back on this deal as an \u2018Instagram-like\u2019
            bargain or a \u2018Pets.com'-sized blunder? And most importantly, can
            *anyone* compete with Amazon going forward? We speculate wildly.  Topics
            covered include:  - Community spotlight: Nowdue, a super fast invoicing
            platform for teams on Slack. Invoice like it\u2019s the future! This looks
            very cool. - Jet\u2019s deep origins in Founder & CEO Marc Lore\u2019s
            first two companies, The Pit and Quidsi (aka, diapers.com) - Lore\u2019s
            chance run-in with Jeff Bezos at a school picnic in Seattle in the early
            2000\u2019s - Amazon's dramatic acquisition of Quidsi in 2010, including
            Bezos\u2019 admonition to Amazon corp dev to keep Quidsi from being bought
            by Walmart under any circumstances (covered well in The Everything Store)
            - Lore\u2019s less-than-favorable opinion of Amazon's culture - Lore's
            vision of Jet as an \u2018online Costco\u2019 that can directly with Amazon
            on price by selling goods to a \u201Chuge middle-class of people\" at
            effectively zero margin, and make profit on membership fees - Jet\u2019s
            huge, pre-launch fundraising rounds, and subsequent massively promoted
            public launch in July 2015 - Jet\u2019s pivot in October 2015 to drop
            the membership model (their only profit engine), and subsequent massive
            growth (but also accompanying massive losses) - 'Admitting defeat\u201D
            to Amazon in July 2016? Immediately followed by the blockbuster $3B+ Walmart
            acquisition announcement - Is e-commerce really a winner-take-all business
            and will Amazon just take over the world? Featuring liberal citations
            (again) of Ben Thompson's Aggregation Theory and the importance of customer
            experience. - Is there any path for Walmart & Jet to compete effectively

          author: Techdirt
          content: The latest entrant on the decentralized transportation scene is
            the suddenly-ubiquitous electric scooters that are taking over San Francisco
            and other cities. Their appearance has triggered the inevitable controversy,
            with some saying they are ruining cities while others laud their convenience
            for urbanites. And, of course, a regulatory battle wasn't far behind.
            On this week's episode, we discuss the e-scooter trend and its many pros
            and cons.

            every VC and founder these days: SoftBank\u2019s $93B+ Vision Fund, and
            its seemingly-overnight rewriting of the rules of venture capital and
            startup fundraising. Where did this new 800lbs gorilla come from, what
            are its goals, and what does it mean for the future of silicon valley
            and the global tech ecosystem? The answer, it turns out, starts with an
            acquisition, and unfolds into a story no one has yet told and few yet
            understand. Luckily our heroes are on the case!"

          content: Gawker's gone, and that's that. And yet, whenever we've expressed
            concerns over the billionaire vendetta that brought it down, we've faced
            a huge amount of pushback from people who had problems with the site and
            its reporting practices. This week, we're joined by Parker Thompson aka
            Startup L. Jackson for a friendly debate about whether the Gawker shutdown
            really is a big deal.

          author: Techdirt
          content: "Not all Kickstarter campaigns are created equal. Even the mostly-good
            ones that eventually satisfy their backers are often plagued with delays
            and poor communication. But once in a while, there's a campaign that runs
            smoothly, communicates openly, and delivers a great product on time as
            promised \u2014 and Minaal is one company that pulled off such a campaign
            to launch its line of travel bags. This week, we're joined by co-founder
            Jimmy Hayes to discuss how they pulled it off and what their experience
            can teach us about other campaigns and the broader crowdfunding ecosystem."

            unfair trial on Espionage Act charges in which he'd be blocked from presenting
            a meaningful defense. A pardon from those charges is the only just choice.
            This week, we're joined by Trevor Timm, co-founder of the Freedom Of The

            Snowden deserves a pardon, and the campaign to get him one deserves your

            systems at the most fundamental levels. But the answer is far from simple
            \u2014 is capitalism dying? Can it evolve? Is the whole question being
            framed incorrectly? This week, we discuss the notion of a post-capitalist

          name: Is Facebook Moderation A Necessary Evil?
          author: Techdirt
          content: Facebook's efforts to moderate content that appears on the social
            network have run into numerous problems, most recently with a famous war
            photo and a bunch of blog posts. Some have made absurd demands in response,
            such as giving old-school media editors special posting privileges, while
            others have objected to the idea of Facebook censoring any content whatsoever.
            But is that objection realistic? This week, we discuss the complicated
            question of Facebook moderation, and what the company's role can and should
            be.

          content: We wanted to do an episode all about examining the tech policy
            platforms of the 2016 presidential candidates, but that proved impossible
            since one candidate's is vague and noncommittal while the other's doesn't
            exist at all. Since a nuanced discussion about robust tech policy platforms
            was probably a bit much to hope for from this election anyway, for this
            week's episode we're discussing what a great presidential tech platform
            should look like under less absurd circumstances.

            TCP/IP, HTTP and SMTP especially, plus more modern entrants like RSS and

            era of the open protocol might be coming to an end, supplanted by the
            drive to create proprietary closed platforms. This week, we discuss whether

          content: "Data breaches that expose passwords are pretty much a fact of
            life at this point \u2014 and the effects are multiplied by the fact that
            many, many people reuse passwords no matter how much they know they shouldn't.
            As such, there's a big push to move to password managers, two-factor authentication,
            and even biometrics \u2014 because the simple fact is the password sucks.
            This week, we're discussing what if anything will succeed in replacing

          content: "On this extra-long episode of Acquired, Brian McCullough from
            the Internet History Podcast returns to discuss perhaps the most (in)famous
            merger of all time: AOL - Time Warner. Who doesn\u2019t remember the soothing
            sounds of 56k modems and the timeless phrase, \u201CYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201D?
            Join us all as we unpack how one of the biggest ISP\u2019s of the 90\u2019s
            tried to take over the world\u2026 and failed.\n\nTopics Covered Include:\n*
            \ AOL\u2019s status in the 90\u2019s / early 00\u2019s\n*  Explaining
            just what it is that AOL did at the height of their popularity\n*  How
            AOL pioneered a number of internet paradigms\n*  AOL\u2019s persistent
            money troubles and bailouts from other companies\n*  Steve Case foreseeing
            the coming era of broadband, inspiring AOL to pursue working with a cable
            company\n*  Ebay vs. Time Warner in a down-to-the-wire war for a merger
            with AOL\n*  Why the money dried up for AOL after their merger with Time
            Warner\n*  AOL and its value in the post-Time-Warner era\n*  Speculating
            about what would have happened had AOL and others stayed independent businesses\n*
            \ And much discussion on how to grade this one\u2026\n\nThe Carve Out:\n*
            Ben: Give and Take by Adam Grant \n* David: Season of the Witch by David
            Talbot \n* Brian: A Mind at Play: How Claude Shannon Invented the Information

          author: Techdirt
          content: Over the past few weeks, a jury heard the second round of the copyright
            fight between Oracle and Google over whether Google's use of the Java
            APIs in Android constituted copyright infringement, or whether it was
            fair use.  In the end, the jury went with fair use.  Reporter Sarah Jeong
            watched the entire trial from the courtroom and joins us on the Techdirt
            podcast this week to discuss both the legal details and the various oddities
            of this particular trial.

          name: The Link Between Credit And Surveillance
          author: Techdirt
          content: Both surveillance and the digitization of money are heavily-discussed
            topics, but the intersection between the two often goes overlooked. Historically,
            credit agencies have been trailblazers in the world of surveillance, and
            today we face the fact that the government can use payment providers and
            other financial tools as a means of enforcing its wishes. On this week's
            episode, we're joined by lawyer and writer Sarah Jeong, who recently wrote
            a four-part series on the subject, to discuss the past and future of credit,
            money, surveillance and the way they work together.

            collaboration with 010101 Music)\r\n\r\nSwedish remixing legend Martin
            Noriander Instant Remedy is finally back with a brand-new album - \"Insert
            Disk 2\" celebrates the 30th anniversary of the Amiga brand with a fine
            selection of arranged game and demoscene tracks from the 16-bit era. Episode
            #202 features tracks from this new album, its predecessor, as well as
            original game music composed by Instant Remedy.\r\n\r\nSays Martin: \"When
            the internet was still young, me and a few classmates discovered the HVSC
            and SIDPLay. All of a sudden it was possible to listen to all those great
            tunes - without the hassle of setting up a real C64 to load the games!
            However, I wanted to add something to the SID music to make it sound fuller
            and suitable for listening on a stereo system. So I started adding some
            drums, bass and other stuff, just for fun. At first, I played these tracks
            for friends only. Remixing game music was not as common back then as it
            is today. They really liked what I had done, so I decided to submit MP3s
            to some sites... and so my remixes started to spread.\"\r\n\r\nMixed by

            decades of Evoke... Oh boy, that means countless hours of great compo
            music and the birth of many genius and creative talents. Artists who know
            how to deliver a great listening experience or who successfully experimented
            in a silly and funny way. Long before KEVIN we heard about a fountain
            called Jockel. We learned that Paniq doesn't need any instruments for
            making music. Enjoying phat beats from glxblt, Bitch or dq was as awesome
            as hearing the comeback of legendary BitArts. Also don't forget Crome,
            who can do the chip-style as good as heavy metal music. These all are
            moments we'd like to share with you again in this episode, featuring the

          content: Net neutrality has a long and complicated history, and despite
            some recent victories, that story is far from over. This week, Mike is

            net neutrality, and what we need to do to fight for it.

            hit from the world of augmented reality \u2014 a technology people have
            been expecting would transform gaming for years. That leaves a big question,

          author: Techdirt
          content: It should surprise nobody that the FBI is seeking even broader
            digital surveillance powers by changing the warrant requirements and expanding
            the power of national security letters. If you're a regular Techdirt reader,
            it also won't surprise you to learn that Senator Ron Wyden is working
            hard to hold the line against this kind of expansion. This week, we're
            joined by Senator Wyden to discuss what the FBI is up to and what the
            public needs to know about it.

          name: Is Your Algorithm Racist?
          author: Techdirt
          content: Algorithms have become a powerful force in the world, but for all
            the impressive good they do, they sometimes show some worrying tendencies.
            Algorithms that discriminate are a problem that nobody's found a solution
            for yet. This week, we discuss why some algorithms appear to be racist,
            and whether there's anything that can be done about it.

            attempting one. This week, Mike and regular co-host Dennis (who is working

            discuss the potential of chatbots and just how much skepticism is warranted."

            ways to solve problems by upending entrenched industries and, often enough,

            meaningless, not all industries are easy to disrupt, and sometimes \"fake

          author: Techdirt
          content: As we've noted recently, the current copyright reform proposal
            being considered by the EU is full of extremely dangerous ideas, from
            mandated filters to a "link tax". This week, we're joined by European
            Parliament member Julia Reda to talk about the details of the regulatory
            process and the problems with the current proposal.

          author: Techdirt
          content: "Recently, Valve sent waves through the PC gaming world by announcing
            an upcoming policy change for its Steam platform: it will no longer enforce
            specific content rules and will allow all games as long as they aren't
            illegal or \"straight-up trolling\". Though it's not exactly clear what
            this means, the reaction from the gaming press has been largely negative,
            and it's hard to say how the new policy will be implemented \u2014 so
            this week myself, Tim Geigner and Cathy Gellis join the podcast to discuss
            just what's going to happen on the biggest platform for PC games."

          content: "Digg was the earliest high flying startup in early social media.
            But then, other startups started to steal the limelight. Digg tried to
            keep up by launching Digg version 4. And\u2026 users hate it. Many people
            feel that the reason Reddit is Reddit today is because the Digg community
            fled their en-masse. Digg Version 4 has become legendary as a redesign
            so disruptive it can kill a company. So, what\u2019s the real story? Today,
            we talk to Will Larson, who was a young engineer working on the launch
            of Digg version "

          content: Nando.net was not only a very early experiment in bringing journalism
            to the web, it was also one of those local ISP's that flowered in the
            era of the early 1990s. Fraser Von Asch was not only one of the key players
            at The News & Observer (thus, "NandO") who brought the project to life,
            he is another person who has straddled the media industry between the
            print and digital eras and can give us some amazing insights into the
            transitions therein... or lack thereof.

            days, which is a crazy startup story in it\u2019s own right. But then
            she worked for a time at Delphi, which was an early online service and
            competitor to AOL and Prodigy that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve covered
            much here before. And then she helped bring the NYTimes online with CyberTimes,
            which, as she said, is forgotten to history even by the New York Times.
            Then on to MSNBC, a crazy hybrid tech and media startup that I don\u2019t
            think we\u2019ve discussed much either. There\u2019s just so many great
            stories here. Please enjoy this conversation with Lisa Napoli.\r\n      "

            it into something positive. I also got to give some thoughts on some generalized
            criticisms that are usually subtweeted in my direction, although how much
            this episode moves the needle, I''ll likely never know.  The presentation,
            by the way, was a lot of fun and I got to meet some really great folks
            who I''d never had the chance to meet. I found out about some long-memory
            examples held up in in the professional spheres, and I hope to research
            those to have what other lessons could have learned. Also, lunch was amazing
            and someone handed me a stack of hard drives.  Also, now you know why

            power of lightning but when it 'strikes' it comes to earth with 1000 times
            more energy that a household electrical system and with more heat than
            the sun but capturing this energy is difficult as Dr Karl Kruszelnicki
            explains.

          author: ABC Radio National
          content: For 50 years air conditioning in commercial buildings has been
            set using the Standard 55 guidelines. But many workplaces aren't staffed
            solely with 40-year-old men dressed in 60s business suits, and that's
            left women out in the cold, as Dr Karl Kruszelnicki argues.

          author: ABC Radio National
          content: We know that the rotation of the Earth is gradually slowing down.
            But what would happen if God, the devil or aliens suddenly and completely

            to improved knowledge about our planet, the geographers can now give us

            original problem. For example, you would think that if you had a fire
            in a data centre, it would make sense to deprive the fire of oxygen by
            flooding the room with an inert gas. But what if the noise of the escaping
            gas is loud enough to kill the spinning hard drives\u2014potentially causing
            more damage than the fire?"

          content: Many of us access the internet, and the world wide web, via wi-fi.
            Wi-fi lets us into a fabulous world of shared knowledge and social interaction.
            On the flip side, it seems that wi-fi can look at us, and perhaps even
            spy on us. It can even recognize moving humans on the other side of a
            wall. And this happens by examining not the content of the wi-fi signal,
            but its strength and timing.

            culture like in 2005? What were the key innovations that ultimately let
            Facebook succeed where others failed? Would Zuckerberg make a good President

            launching?"

            for me in the long run - so there's a silver lining. More than a few people
            are asking me to consider adding interview episodes to this podcast. I'd
            honestly like to ask you all what you think of that. I assume it'd be
            me and someone interesting talking for an hour, and then turning that
            into something smooth. It sure wouldn't be 20 minutes, and I am of the
            opinion it's basically another whole type of show. Maybe a bonus scattered
            here and there? I just don't see how it fits in the format and folks who
            like the sub-30-minutes running time will find themselves really behind.
            Well, let me know.  \_ \_"

            on the office floor of the Internet Archive, I went for a grab bag of
            random thoughts, so this episode is very, very loose. I also didn''t have
            my pop shield out here, so apologies to your speakers. I mention the Patreon
            stupid and also offer PODCAST.TEXTFILES.COM as the secure central information
            and donation vector for this podcast going forward. It has been quite
            the ride watching support drop and return for this Patreon, and I don''t
            need more uncertainty in my life, thanks.  Opinion seems to float that
            people would like an interview show or similar, but I''d probably make
            it a bonus, because it would be different than this format, and notably
            longer. We''ll see when that happens, but it''s on my mind. Next episodes
            will be much less miscellaneous, but it felt great to talk about it all.
            Thanks for riding along.'

          content: Andy. With the close of the year comes the exciting prospect of
            how next year's taxes will be handled. Naturally, I'll be having an accountant
            help me. I bring this up as I have multiple times in the past because
            I've run into a number of people who have tax issues who are some sort
            of ashamed that they're experiencing problems or bumps, and feel in some
            way this makes them look bad. If I may, please let me be the first to
            say that taxes are not intuitive and you can't just wing them or think
            it's something you might get perfectly right going it alone. This is doubly
            the case now that the tax laws are changing. Don't avoid dealing with
            them, like I did. Next up for me regarding this podcast will be refining
            delivery and process. It's fun to learn on the way.

            I think they''re important here and there, but I try to lay it all down
            here, give you some pointers and thoughts, and hopefully inspire you to
            make your own. And I give an offer at the end. I''m always experimenting,
            so the podcast is not nailed down into a specific processed style that
            would come from a team working on it - so this episode is very dynamic
            and energetic. Learning my limits and what works and doesn''t is always

            time, but in the past year these issues have gotten a huge amount of increased
            focus \u2014 for a bunch of fairly obvious reasons. But a lot of people
            who are fairly new to the issue tend to make a lot of questionable assumptions
            and jump to some problematic conclusions, so this week we're joined by
            someone who has been studying these questions for many years \u2014 Annemarie
            Bridy, a law professor at the University of Idaho and Affiliate Scholar
            at the Stanford University Center for Internet and Society \u2014 to discuss

            fascinating one that ties in a lot of the topics we discuss here at Techdirt.

            large, a whole lot of attention has been turned to Facebook and its role
            in modern democracy. The social network has responded by announcing another
            round of news feed changes, the true impact of which (if any) remains
            far from clear. This week, we're joined by Mathew Ingram from the Columbia
            Journalism Review to talk about Facebook's changes, and whether we can
            or should expect them to fix anything.

          content: "When a tech company is huge and dominant, it can feel like competing
            with them is impossible. Worse still, it can sometimes feel like innovating
            is impossible, since they might just step in and take over as soon as
            someone executes on a good idea. Once upon a time this was how startups
            felt about Microsoft, while today it's more likely to be Google or Facebook.
            But no company, no matter how mighty, is immune to being disrupted \u2014
            and figuring out how is the subject of this week's episode."

          content: "Last week, Mike sparked lots of conversation with his post about
            rethinking the marketplace of ideas without losing sight of the importance
            of the fundamental principles of free speech. Naturally, there's plenty
            more to discuss on that topic, so this week we're joined by Buzzfeed general
            counsel Nabiha Syed \u2014 whose recent article in the Yale Law Journal,
            Real Talk About Fake News, offered a thorough and insightful look at free
            speech online \u2014 to try to cut through all the simplistic takes on
            free speech and talk about where things are going.\r\n\r\nMike's post:

          author: Techdirt
          content: Even those of us who believe that the internet is overall a tremendous
            positive force when it comes to discourse and culture can admit that,
            in many parts of the online world, having constructive and substantive
            conversations is... difficult. And that issue has most certainly come
            to the fore in the last couple of years. So this week, we're joined by
            author Barry Eisler (one of our first and most frequent podcast guests)
            to tackle the challenge of framing important debates in productive ways,
            and actually getting somewhere with them.

            course \u2014 but also the modern rise of board games, tabletop RPGs and
            other forms of analog gaming. A good game does more than just arbitrarily
            pair play with a veneer of narrative, it marries the mechanics and the
            ideas to enable interesting new ways of conveying and exploring complex
            ideas. This week, we're joined by game designer Randy Lubin to discuss
            how games can tell stories in a way nothing else can."

            delayed by an outage at our cloud recording provider, the episode is still
            an interesting listen, with frequent Techdirt contributor Cathy Gellis
            joining the podcast to discuss the deeper question of whether copyright
            truly even exists on the interviews in the first place. Sorry for the
            delay, and we hope you enjoy it!

          author: Techdirt
          content: 'As smartphones and other mobile devices have gotten smarter and
            smarter, they''ve taken over more and more of most people''s general computing
            needs, and the importance of the classic personal computer has waned.
            And so for some time the question has been: will the PC ever go away entirely?
            That''s our topic this week as we try to figure out who really needs a
            PC these days, and when and if that will change.'

          author: Techdirt
          content: Facebook is under a lot of scrutiny these days over its advertising
            and content moderation systems, especially since the high-profile revelation
            of Russia-backed ads during the election. But are things being blown out
            of proportion? And what, exactly, is to be done? This week we dig in to
            Facebook's ongoing advertising scandals, and debate what they really mean.

            the very beginning.

            such things as touch screen computing, but the kids introduced and pioneered
            concepts like forums, message boards, e-mail, chat rooms, instant messaging,
            multiplayer games and even emoticons/emojis were pioneered on the Plato

            it the perfect topic to explore via the medium of podcasts. This week,
            we've got a pair of guests who are doing exactly that: Ken White of Popehat
            fame, who recently launched the Make No Law podcast about First Amendment
            issues, and Elizabeth Joh, co-host of the What Trump Can Teach Us About
            Constitutional Law podcast. Instead of picking their brains about the
            law itself, we've got an episode all about their experience using podcasts
            to teach people about legal issues."

            still processing the story they told in a recent two-part episode about
            the insane lengths that host Alex Goldman went to track down a phone scammer.
            If you haven't heard the story, and you think you've seen all there is
            to see on the \"messing with scammers\" front... well, you're in for a
            surprise. We strongly suggest you listen to the Reply All story first
            \u2014 then listen to our conversation with Alex about the whole saga
            on this week's episode of the Techdirt Podcast.\r\n\r\nReply All Episode

          content: "Recently, we've been writing about SESTA, Congress' latest attack
            on Section 230 of the CDA, and helping to organize a campaign against
            it. But there's still a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation out
            there regarding the bill, so this week we're joined by Daphne Keller from
            Stanford's Center For Internet And Society and Emma Llans\xF3 from the
            Center for Democracy and Technology to dig deeper into the problems with
            the bill and why protecting Section 230 is vital."

          author: Techdirt
          content: "The economy is important \u2014 very important. But is that because
            it matters in and of itself, or because it's the engine for achieving
            the things we really do care about? Here at Techdirt we've always been
            strong advocates of the free market, but we've never been absolutists
            about things like regulation, and we believe it's very important to explore
            these issues in detail. This week on the podcast we're joined by James
            Allworth, co-host of the Exponent podcast and author of a recent post
            entitled Prioritizing Economics is Crippling the U.S. Economy, to discuss
            entrepreneurship, democracy, the economy and more.\r\n\r\nRead the article:

          content: "After the recent launch of po.et, which aims to use the blockchain
            to create a new business model for digital media companies, Mike was...
            unconvinced. This led to a Twitter discussion with CEO Jarrod Dicker,
            which in turn led to a longer in-person conversation about the ideas behind
            the service and where it might go \u2014 and you can listen to the whole
            thing on this week's podcast episode."

          content: Social media can be an extremely powerful tool for gathering, finding
            and sharing the news. It can also be... a bit of a disaster. It would
            be nice if such an important question had a simple answer, but they never
            do, do they? So this week, we're discussing and dissecting whether or
            not social media is "good" for the way we consume the news.

          author: Adam Ruins Everything
          content: "Do you remember all of those video games that were made for girls
            back in the 90s? Well they're not being archived the same way that stereotypical
            boy games are being preserved. They don't have value in the gaming community
            and many of these games are being forgotten even though they were just
            as creative and innovative for the industry. Our guest Rachel Weil is
            trying to change that by preserving these 'girl' games by going around
            the world and collecting these games and talking to the people who made
            them. She is a software developer for Microsoft and the founder of the
            Femicom Museum,  a hybrid physical/digital museum and archive dedicated
            to the preservation and reimagination of femininity, girlhood, and the
            aesthetics of cute within twentieth-century video games, computing, and
            electronic toys. Rachel did not appear on the Adam Ruins Everything TV
            show but her work reminded us of the themes we explored in our Adam Ruins
            Summer Fun episode. And since we're in the off-season of the TV show,
            we'll be inviting more guests onto the podcast whose work relates to themes
            we explored on the TV show or who are doing fascinating work or research
            that's worth discussing anyway. On the podcast Adam and Rachel had a lively
            discussion about gender expectations, the negative effects of marketing
            towards girls and boys, their favorite classic games and even their favorite
            savory breakfasts.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter @AdamConover and you can

            Can Improve Cancer Research'
          author: Adam Ruins Everything
          content: "When we think of conducting science experiments on subjects, we
            immediately think of mice models. But today's guest, Dr. Azra Raza, who
            appeared on Adam Ruins Science, says there's a more effective way. On
            the TV show Dr. Raza discussed how the mouse model scientists use for
            their research is actually ineffective; even though a medicine might work
            well on a rodent, the results don't translate as well as we thought to
            humans - especially when it comes to cancer research which is what Dr.
            Raza studies. Even though humans and mice share over 90 percent of their
            DNA with one another, our bodies still differ in numerous ways; we metabolize
            food and medicine differently and humans are significantly bigger than
            mice in size. This wastes money from the limited amount of funding that
            already exists and encourages clinical trials that ultimately go nowhere.
            On the podcast, Dr. Raza proposes a different research method that she
            has used herself, to much success.\r\n\r\nDr. Raza is a Professor of Medicine
            and Director of the MDS Center at Columbia University in New York. Previously
            she conducted her research at Rush University, Chicago, Illinois in 1992,
            where she was the Charles Arthur Weaver Professor in Oncology and Director,
            Division of Myeloid Diseases.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter @AdamConover and

          content: "While they may sport perfectly manicured lawns and beautiful white
            picket fences, suburbs are not the idyllic neighborhoods we think they
            are. They make us more sedentary, sometimes less safe, and they can even
            perpetuate segregation. But instead of leaving the suburbs we can actually
            address these issues and improve our suburbs through redevelopment and
            retrofitting neighborhoods to make them greener, healthier, safer and
            more affordable. Our guest Ellen Dunham-Jones, who appeared on Adam Ruins
            the Suburbs, tells us all about it. She has spent her career studying
            how suburbs can adapt to these 21st century challenges. Ellen is a leading
            authority on suburban redevelopment and is the Professor of Architecture
            and Urban Design at Georgia Tech.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter @AdamConover

          author: Adam Ruins Everything
          content: "As humans, our inclination is to live in the present - not save
            40 years down the line - which makes saving money for retirement hard.
            In the 90s many companies began offering 401(k) programs, a retirement
            savings plan sponsored by an employer which lets workers save and invest
            a piece of their paycheck before taxes. It seemed like the perfect solution
            to our retirement woes. But 401(k)s aren't the full proof saving plan
            we once thought. Even judiciously setting aside money in a 401(k) might
            not be enough to maintain one's lifestyle into retirement. There are also
            so many outside factors that can still diminish one's savings, including
            unexpected healthcare costs, recessions, or lost jobs. So how do we set
            ourselves up for a secure financial future?\r\n\r\nOur guest Professor
            Teresa Ghilarducci, who appeared on Adam Ruins the Future, is going to
            tell us how we entered into this financial mess and how we can get out
            of it. She suggests we do the best we can to save through 401(k)s, live
            within our means, start planning our financial future as young as we can,
            delay collecting social security as much as we can, and vote for representatives
            who can help reform this system. Teresa is a labor economist and nationally-recognized
            expert in retirement security. She's also a professor of economics at
            The New School for Social Research.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter @AdamConover

          author: Adam Ruins Everything
          content: "Placebos are commonly dismissed as \"fake\" treatments that have
            no real power on you or your body. But scientists are realizing more and
            more that placebos are more powerful than we realized. New research shows
            that while placebos may not cure diseases, they can reduce symptoms of
            our ailments like irritable bowel syndrome and even Parkinson's disease,
            and in the process actually make us feel better. Even traditional medicine
            takes advantage of the placebo effect, which could mean the placebo effect
            could play a significant role in treating diseases. On this episode we
            talk to Dr. Kathryn Hall, who appeared on Adam Ruins Spa Day, about how
            placebos can have such powerful effects on our brains and how placebos
            are changing the way we conduct science and treat patients. Kathryn is
            a molecular biologist and Director of Placebo Genetics at Harvard Medical
            School's Program in Placebo Studies.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter @AdamConover

          author: Adam Ruins Everything
          content: |-
            What once seemed like a fringe movement, conspiracy theories appear more pervasive than ever. Our guest Dr. Daniel Jolley points out, conspiracy theories have been around for centuries; social media, however, has given them a wider platform and megaphone. Believing in such theories can seem like harmless speculation. But if enough people accept ideas like the faking of the moon landing or 9/11 being a government inside job, they'll feel they have no agency. This can lead to very dangerous effects like lower voter turnout and less civic engagement at large. Daniel, who appeared on Adam Ruins Conspiracy Theories, explains why people believe in conspiracy theories in the first place, how people can believe in two contradictory conspiracy theories, and how we can combat these theories to create a healthier democracy. He studies conspiracy theories at Staffordshire University in the United Kingdom.

            But what are the real facts regarding immigration history in this country?
            And what are immigrants' \_actual impacts on our society? Today we try

            race and housing, discrimination, education, urban poverty, and Latin

            the United States' reliance on migrant labor, and what reasonable immigration
            policy looks like."

            \u2014 especially after it was revealed that the whole thing was caused
            by a typo. So this week we're discussing whether something needs to be

            market debut. From playing a central role in the early days of Y Combinator,
            to having Steve Jobs famously label the company a \u201Cfeature not a
            product\u201D, to pivoting from consumers to enterprise to developers
            and back again, the silicon valley history runs deep with this one. What
            twists and turns lie ahead for Dropbox as a public company? We speculate!"

          author: The Planetary Society
          content: "The New Horizons mission was a triumph, revealing Pluto as an
            utterly unique and beautiful world. But the mission first had to survive
            challenge after challenge, fighting to be developed, meeting a nearly
            impossible launch deadline, and then narrowly avoiding disaster when it
            was barely a week from its destination. The entire dramatic tale has now
            been told by Principal Investigator Alan Stern and his co-author, astrobiologist
            David Grinspoon.&nbsp; They join Mat Kaplan to talk about their book,
            Chasing New Horizons\u2014Inside the Epic First Mission to Pluto.&nbsp;
            A signed copy of the book will go to the winner of this episode\u2019s

            its decentralization, but over time we've seen a bunch of different forces

            of our time \u2014 and for a long time, smartphone design was a hotbed

            So where does this technology go next? That's the subject of this weeks
            episode, in which we try to figure out whether smartphone innovation is

          content: "This week's episode is all about copyright and culture, with a
            pair of the best guests you could ask for on the subject. Almost ten years
            ago, law professors Keith Aoki, James Boyle and Jennifer Jenkins released
            a comic book about copyright called Bound By Law, and now they are back
            with a sequel: Theft: A History of Music. This week, James and Jennifer
            join us to discuss the new comic and the history of copyright and music
            (with lots of fair use music snippets to demonstrate the legacy of 'theft')!\r\n\r\nYou
            should also be sure to check out the comic itself! You can download a
            digital copy for free of course, but for those who want to get their hands
            on the beautiful paperback edition, we've got a limited time offer for
            Techdirt fans: you can get it for only $8.99 at Createspace (that's 40%
            off!) when you use the discount code 2FESBPRQ within the next two weeks.
            It's also available on Amazon with a free Kindle edition included when
            you buy."

          content: This week we've got a special crossover episode with our friends
            at TechFreedom. Mike joined their Tech Policy Podcast recently to discuss
            notice and takedown systems and the future of internet copyright, and
            we're cross-posting the conversation as an episode of the Techdirt Podcast
            too.

          author: Techdirt
          content: 'It doesn''t take many stories of people suffering due to unaffordable
            medicine to make you question the state of pharmaceutical patents, but
            the arguments in their defense are loud and frequent. Most are variations
            on the same theme: without the promise of a monopoly, important drugs
            would never be researched and developed. But does this argument truly
            hold up? It''s come up as a tangent in previous episodes of the podcast,
            but this week we''re dedicating a full episode to questioning the popular
            defenses of pharma patents and looking for a better way forward.'

          content: 'The basic impetus behind DRM is obvious: a frantic, misguided
            desire to make digital products behave like physical ones. But the truth
            is DRM goes far, far beyond that, restricting all sorts of activities
            that are intrinsic to the idea of "owning" something. Two people who have
            thought a lot about this are law professors Aaron Perzanowski and Jason
            Schultz, authors of the new book The End Of Ownership. This week, Aaron
            and Jason join the podcast to discuss the book and the worrying status
            of DRM today.'

          author: Techdirt
          content: Since Congress threw out new privacy rules for ISPs that were supposed
            to come into effect soon, there's been a renewed uproar on all sides of
            the debate about internet regulation. While the big ISPs generally want
            to be able to do as they please, there are smaller service providers out
            there that fully understand and embrace the need for privacy, net neutrality
            and more. One such ISP is Sonic, and this week we're joined by CEO Dane
            Jasper to discuss why these rules are a good thing.

          content: "For a long time now, \"use a VPN\" has been the default online
            privacy advice \u2014 but is it really so effective? Following the recent
            VPN boom that came on the tails of Congress scrapping new ISP privacy
            rules, a few security experts have stepped forward to explain how VPNs
            aren't all they're cracked up to be, and choosing and using one isn't
            as easy as many articles and social media posts suggest. Among them are
            this week's guests, Kevin Riggle (who provided a quick and dirty primer
            with the key suggestion that most people are safer not using a VPN) and
            Kenn White (who assembled a list of VPNs he deems \"terrible\" and not
            without good reason, recommending a roll-your-own solution instead). They
            join us to dig deeper into the reality of VPNs and hopefully help some
            people make better choices."

            workers. I assumed there were very specific use cases for them, but Jeremy
            opened our eyes to the fact that they allow access to some very powerful
            browser features and are useful across the board.\n\nWe also spoke about
            Jeremy's recently released A Book Apart Book 'Going Offline', I'm really
            enjoying it. I can't put it any better than Sarah Drasner (https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com),

            and humour in his new book, a must-read for any web developer who wants
            to learn this exciting new API and enable offline experiences for their
            applications.\"\n\nThe first chapter is available as an A List Apart article,
            link below. \n\nThere were some strong Jukebox Entries this time. Jeremy
            Chose Catastrophe And The Cure by Explosions In The Sky, from one of my
            very favourite albums. Ben chose The Celestial Garden by DrumTalk but
            apparently described a different track in the episode, he's a sleep deprived

            time I''ve been fired so far! Not bad for roughly 20 years of working
            life. I am pretty sure I got most of the details right, but you never
            know. I say this compared to most of the talking about history I do because
            it seems to be that when a person describes an emotionally traumatic event,
            they tend to get details real weird - it must be how the brain copes.

          author: Techdirt
          content: "In the last few years, a lot of the conversation around technology
            in general has shifted its focus from excitement about the obvious benefits
            to concern about its downfalls and side effects. It even feels like there's
            a general sense that \"technology is bad for society\" in a lot of places.
            This comes with a lot of associated myths, including the prominent idea
            that \"if you're not paying for something, you're the product being sold\"
            \u2014 an idea that is, at best a massive oversimplification. So on this
            week's podcast we're discussing the changing cultural attitudes towards
            technology, especially free online services and the many myths and misunderstandings
            about how they operate."

          author: Techdirt
          content: Innovation isn't easy, but success in Silicon Valley involves a
            bigger dose of luck than a lot of entrepreneurs seem prepared to admit.
            Chance gets left out of the economic equation all too often, and this
            week we're joined by Mike's own Econ 101 professor from Cornell, Robert
            Frank, to discuss the role of luck in the world of entrepreneurs and innovation.

            had him on the podcast once before. Now, in what started as a project
            to promote his latest novel, Reid is hosting a podcast called After On,
            which tackles some pretty crazy real-world topics \u2014 from alien life
            to mind-reading technology \u2014 befitting a science fiction writer.
            This week, he returns to our podcast to discuss what it's like interviewing
            big thinkers about mind-bending ideas."

            live in.\_But guess what? That's only half of this episode! Because it
            turns out, Robert is the author of a book that was probably one of the
            biggest reasons I started doing this podcast. The book was Architects
            of the Web, 1000 Days that Built the Future of Business. It was one of
            the first books to come out about the history of the web era. It was published
            in 1997, "

            the clash between Apple and the FBI, but in truth the tension over encryption
            has been around for a long time \u2014 and it doesn't look like it's going
            away anytime soon. As our readers know, Tim Cushing has been following
            these developments closely, and this week he joins the podcast for a discussion
            about encryption, law enforcement and \"going dark\"."

            on destroying it, and this is quickly turning into a fight for the future
            of the internet. This week, we're joined by Gigi Sohn, one of former chairman
            Tom Wheeler top advisors at the FCC and now a fellow at the Open Society
            Foundation, to discuss what's happening at the FCC and what needs to be
            done in response.

          author: Techdirt
          content: "Elon Musk got plenty of attention recently for announcing his
            plans to colonize Mars. But that's not exactly a new idea \u2014 so we
            wondered if it was really a different, exciting and realistic plan, or
            just a reiteration of the standard far-flung dream. To answer that question,
            we brought in three experts: Amy Shira Teitel (a space and flight historian
            and creator of YouTube's Vintage Space videos), JPL's Fred Calef (a Mars
            geologist and \"keeper of the maps\" for Mars rovers), and the New Space
            Intiative's Tanya Harrison (who worked on Curiosity and several other
            Mars missions). The result was a fascinating discussion about Mars and
            whether or not we're actually headed there any time soon."

          name: Autonomous Cars Are Accelerating
          author: Techdirt
          content: The adoption of self-driving cars is rapidly changing from science
            fiction to present reality. We had a preliminary discussion on the subject
            here on the podcast a couple years ago, but today we're digging more deeply
            the impact this is having, especially on policy. R Street Institute senior
            fellow Ian Adams joins us as a special guest this week for a discussion
            about the many implications of this accelerating technological shift.

          name: Where Do You Get Your News?
          author: Techdirt
          content: The news industry has been in an ongoing state of upheaval ever
            since the dawn of the internet. In addition to the many ways that technology
            changes reporting and publishing, there has also been a profound effect
            on how people find their news. This week, we step away from the big debate
            about echo chambers and filter bubbles, and talk about evolving news-finding
            habits and what they mean for the industry.

          author: Techdirt
          content: On the surface, the idea of "pro and con" debates seems like a
            good way to ensure an issue is fully explored. But is it truly a productive
            approach? This week, we debate the nature of debates and possible alternatives
            to the adversarial approach.

          author: Techdirt
          content: For obvious reasons, politics and government are on just about
            everyone's mind at the moment, prompting a vast range of reactions and
            opinions. A lot of people who share a desire for change are divided not
            only by what form they think that change should take, but by what methods
            they think should be employed to achieve it. Former Senate staffer and
            long-time Techdirt friend Jennifer Hoelzer recently wrote a column entitled
            Your Government Won't Change... Unless You Do and this week she joins
            us on the podcast to delve further into this idea and what it means for
            optimists, cynics, pragmatists and everyone else.

          content: "The internet of things has been taking plenty of flack ever since
            the first time someone floated the idea of a connected fridge or some-such
            in the 90s \u2014 but despite the knee-jerk instinct to scoff at some
            things, the truth is there are all sorts of interesting possibilities
            emerging from all these \"pointless\" connected devices. Of course, there
            are also some serious security concerns... This week, we discuss IoT and
            what the ever-increasing presence of such devices means for the future."

            folks often agree there is a role for government intervention. In the
            world of tech, multiple big antitrust fights have broken out and continue
            to rage in both America and the EU \u2014 but how effective is this kind
            of regulation and how often should it really happen? This week, we discuss
            whether or not there is a role for antitrust in the world of technological
            innovation."

          author: Techdirt
          content: "Software patents have been dubious since their inception \u2014
            not just in principle, but legally too. Past rulings have called their
            validity into serious question, and now an opinion from a prominent pro-patent
            judge has called for people to admit that they simply shouldn't exist.
            This week, we discuss what this opinion means for the (hopefully short)
            future of software patents."

            for a while, it's picked up a huge amount of steam following the election

            has long been of the opinion that pointing fingers at Facebook is misguided,
            there are plenty of people who disagree. This week, we're joined by one
            such person \u2014 long-time media commentator and senior editor at Fortune
            Mathew Ingram \u2014 for a lively debate about just how much of a problem
            the filter bubble really is, and how you'd go about solving it."

            is hardly above criticism: the Electoral College has had all sorts of
            unanticipated and often undesirable effects on democracy, and a wide variety
            of alternatives have been proposed. This week we discuss the question:
            is there a better way to pick the president?'

            The party attempts to infiltrate the seedy underbelly of Ezry to track down Skullis -- a notorious R. Cane dealer and killer of Stunkbug's brother. Hardwon becomes a prize fighter, Moonshine is hellbent on stealing a little blue hat, Beverly becomes a valet, and Stunkbug comes face to face with his nemesis, who is much different than he remembers. Adam Conover joins us!

            development of products like Google Docs, Google Calendar and Google Mobile
            Maps. But he was also early at JotSpot which became Google sites, was
            a product manager at Yahoo, was an early employee at CNET and was CTO
            of Snap, a company probably none of you have ever heard of but I\u2019ve
            been dying to talk about for years. No. Not snapchat. The original Snap.
            The dotcom era snap. "

          author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
          content: "I said in the book, I think TheGlobe.com was the quintessential
            dot-com company. We spoke to one of the cofounders previously, Todd Krizelman.
            Todd was great, but he was time constrained and he didn\u2019t quite get
            as personal about the story as I would have hoped. Well, I finally got
            to talk to the other founder of TheGlobe, Stephan Paternot. And Stephan
            was\u2026 AMAZING. He shared the whole story, the whole wild ride, from
            a historical angle, from a business angle, from an entrepreneurial angle
            and also, from a very personal angle. THIS the dot-com era story I\u2019ve
            been looking for for years. It\u2019s also the story of probably the most
            important pioneer of social media before there was even a term for such
            a thing. And by the way\u2026 that TV Show that just came out on NAT GEO,
            Valley of the Boom? THIS IS THAT STORY. Stephan just re-released his book,
            A Very Public Offering: The Story of theglobe.com and the First Internet
            Revolution."

            the lateness of the hour, but I still enjoyed the conversation.

          author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
          content: 'Napster was an incredible phenomenon, reaching tens of millions
            of users at its height, and though Jordan Ritter didn''t invent Napster,
            he very much was responsible for scaling it and turning it into the phenomenon
            it became. In today''s episode, Jordan recounts the entire Napster story,
            from its gestation in the w00w00 hacker collective (which, by the way,
            people talk a lot about the PayPal mafia, but an argument can be made
            for a w00w00 mafia) all the way through Napster''s legal descent into
            oblivion. '

            Why Do I Podcast. Just felt like putting down my thoughts and perspective
            on Podcasting, in advance of the Great Podcast Boom/Bust of 2019-2020.
            I podcast for a reason, and I re-iterate it in this episode: Because when
            looking to pay off debts, I wanted to also produce something beyond selling
            a shirt or doing a fundraiser with nothing else to come of it besides
            stasis. At 60 episodes, this is quite a body of work, and you''ve been
            inspirational in helping me create it.'

            it isn't an automatic good thing all by itself: implementation and intention
            matters, and that means political entanglements and complicated questions
            about governance, and that calls for big, new ideas. This week, we're
            joined by Tamara Winter from the Center for Innovative Governance Research
            to discuss new experiments in government like charter cities and special
            autonomous zones.\r\n\r\nAlso, learn more about:\r\n\r\nShenzhen - https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2501/564470PUB0buil10Box349496B01PUBLIC1.pdf?sequen\r\n\r\nVal

          author: Techdirt
          content: Of all the laws we discuss here at Techdirt, probably none comes
            up as often or in relation to as many things as Section 230 of the Communications
            Decency Act. It's not an exaggeration to describe it the way Professor
            Jeff Kosseff does in the title of his new book, The Twenty-Six Words That
            Created The Internet, offering a detailed history of this vital piece
            of law. This week, Jeff joins us on the podcast for an in-depth discussion
            about where Section 230 came from, and where it's going.

          name: 193. The Home Page Film With Doug Block
          author: Brian McCullough
          content: "20 years ago, the acclaimed documentarian Doug Block released
            a landmark film, Home Page. Doug\u2019s documentary accidentally chronicled
            the birth of blogging, featuring several people we\u2019ve talked to on
            this very show, including Justin Hall. But the documentary also captured
            a moment in time, the web going mainstream, the beginnings of the dotcom
            bubble, the early days of Wired, Hotwired and Suck and also so many of
            the things I ask people about on here regularly. How people learned to
            live online, to begin to port all of modern life over to the digital.
            Well, Home Page is celebrating its 20th anniversary with a re-release,
            and starting this week, you can watch it yourself everywhere films are
            gettable, including iTunes. Today we speak to Doug Block about this amazing
            movie that I think is one of the best historical records of the era we
            have been interrogating for nearly 5 years on this podcast. Go watch Home
            Page yourself, and check out The D-word, Doug\u2019s community for documentarians,
            at D-word.com."

          content: Today we continue my efforts to preserve the history of the ISP
            industry. Today it feels like the Internet is simply all around us all
            the time, but there are amazing entrepreneurial stories about how that
            crucial infrastructure was laid. Today we talk to Sonic founder Dane Jasper,
            who can not only give us the history of the industry, but the present
            day as well, as Sonic is still a thriving and important independent ISP.

            We now share Twitter names instead of domains; even web developers tweet
            and post on Medium instead of their own sites. We scroll social media
            and feel empty instead of reading news & blogs to feel informed and connected.
            Algorithmic feeds amplify rage & conspiracies, enabling tribal ad-targeting
            to polarise and spread misinformation, threatening democracy itself.\r\nWhat
            happened? And what are we doing to fix it?\r\nThat's a big question that
            will require all of us, our communities, our employers, to shift. I don't
            want to wait, and you probably don't either.\r\nWhat can you do for yourself,
            today?\r\nOwn your domain. Own your content. Own your social connections.
            Own your reading experience. IndieWeb services, tools, and standards enable

            fading from public discourse anyway, but it received a bump when co-founder
            Chris Hughes called for the company to be broken up. This week, we've
            got two returning guests on the podcast with plenty to say on the subject
            \u2014 UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression David Kaye, and
            famed internet lawyer Mike Godwin \u2014 to discuss the many sides of
            the Facebook question."

          content: Analysts say that many countries and companies will soon be forced
            to make a decision between the Chinese version of the Internet and the
            liberal, Western model - both models have a very different underlaying
            philosophy and understanding of governance.

          name: Politicians (Usually) Don't Understand Technology
          author: Techdirt
          content: The regulation of technology is an extremely important issue that
            impacts all our lives, but it tends to take a back seat in the world of
            mainstream politics, and when it does come to the fore, the lack of knowledge
            on display among elected representatives can be... disheartening, to say
            the least. In some ways that's starting to change as a generation of people
            who grew up with modern technology gets more and more involved in politics,
            but we're still a long, long way away from having a majority of tech-savvy
            (or even tech-literate) lawmakers. This week, we're joined by lawyer and
            pioneering law blogger Denise Howell to discuss the challenge of even
            determining whether a politician knows what they are talking about when
            it comes to tech.

          content: "Podcast #479: Becoming a Digital Minimalist\r\n\r\nPracticing
            minimalism with your possessions has been a trend for the past decade,
            and it can be a worthy practice, as long as you use it as a means to greater
            efficacy outside your personal domain, rather than just an end in itself.\r\n\r\nBut
            there\u2019s arguably a minimalism practice that\u2019s even more effective
            in achieving that greater efficacy: digital minimalism.\r\n\r\nMy guest
            has written the definitive guide to the philosophy and tactics behind
            digital minimalism. His name is Cal Newport and this is his third visit
            to the AoM Podcast. We\u2019ve had him on the show previously to discuss
            his books So Good They Can\u2019t Ignore You and Deep Work. Today, we
            discuss his latest book, Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in
            a Noisy World.\r\n\r\nWe begin our conversation discussing why digital
            tech feels so addicting, why Steve Jobs didn\u2019t originally intend
            for the iPhone to become something we check all the time, and why the
            common tips for reducing your smartphone use don\u2019t work and you need
            to implement more nuclear solutions instead. We then discuss the surprising
            lesson the Amish can teach you about being intentional about technology,
            how cleaning up your digital life is like decluttering your house, and
            why he recommends a 30-day tech fast to evaluate what tech you want to
            let back into your life. Cal then makes an argument for why you should
            see social media like training wheels for navigating the web, how to take
            those wheels off, and why you should own your own domain address. We end
            our conversation exploring what you should do in the free time you open

            you can use to take the practice of digital minimalism to the next level.\r\n\r\nI

          content: Jon Callas has been at the forefront of computer security issues
            for a long time, most recently as the head of Apple's team of internal
            hackers that try to break into the company's own products. But just a
            couple of months ago, he made a change, and left Apple to work on tech
            policy at the ACLU. This week, he joins us on the podcast to discuss the
            new job, computer security policy, and the latest phase of the crypto-wars.

          content: 'One of the most common responses to various complaints about giant
            tech companies is that you can just not use their products and services.
            Many people have pointed out just how difficult that would really be,
            but Gizmodo''s Kashmir Hill decided to try it for real: she cut Amazon,
            Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Apple out of her life for a week each,
            followed by a week without any of them. Her report on that final, empty
            week is coming out soon, but in the mean time she joins us on the podcast
            to talk about what it''s like to live without big tech.'

            long time that new works have actually entered the public domain in the
            US! The Internet Archive and Creative Commons hosted a celebration of
            this fact, and this week we're joined by IA's Lila Bailey and CC's Timothy
            Vollmer to talk about that event and the exciting possibilities of a re-opened
            public domain.

          content: "It's no secret that journalism outfits are struggling, and have
            been for some time. There are lots of competing ideas about why this is
            the case, and who to blame, but the ultimate question is the same: how
            do we fund good journalism going forward? This week, Mike is joined on
            the podcast by someone whose opinions on this question differ significantly
            from his own \u2014 Columbia Journalism professor and former online editor-in-chief
            of the Guardian Emily Bell \u2014 to talk about whether journalism can
            survive the free market, and what the alternatives are."

            the Wall Street Journal and we haven\u2019t done enough to explore their
            path to embracing the internet. It\u2019s worth doing that because they
            embraced a different model from basically day one. Almost alone among
            the web media pioneers, the Journal went the subscription route. So, we\u2019re
            going to talk to Rich Jaroslovksy, who headed the team that brought the

            what happens when you've been through the wringer. When you've been to
            the top of the rollercoaster and also down to the bottom. Here's how you

          content: "It\u2019s bothered me for a while that over the 5 years or so
            of this podcast, we haven\u2019t focused very much on some corners of
            the history. For example\u2026 the legal side? Copyright law? Intellectual
            property law? How much have we talked about disruption and piracy and
            filesharing and all that stuff? So, I spoke to Richard Chapo, who has
            been doing Internet Law since the web went mainstream. We talk about the
            Napster era, we talk about how much of an influence the adult industry
            had on digital law, we talk about the state of digital law today, and
            actually, a whole bunch of contemtorary law stuff like GDPR."

            incredibly quickly, so I can''t do it any more (people have tried to get

            game and moved into movie making and computers, and while it''s sad I
            let that talent go, I did some other good stuff with it!  I idly looked
            up how street performing did after we got flushed out, and it turns out
            that this year, this year, they just changed the rules and policies regarding
            performing and fees and technically, I could start up again! (But I''m

          author: Mozilla
          content: "Look, we agree with you: passwords are the worst. But you know
            what else is the worst? Someone hacking your account, or big security
            breaches that expose your email, your credit card information, your government-issued
            identification number, and more. We should hold companies accountable
            for better security, but we also need to hold ourselves accountable for
            having good password hygiene. So let's tackle this once and for all. Hear
            from Buzzfeed's Mat Honan, who endured a brutal hack a few years ago when
            hackers exploited password-recovery tools; Mark Wilson from Fast Company,
            who wants to ban passwords altogether (though admits it's not the best
            idea); Masha Sedova of Elevate Security who says that, yes, security companies
            have failed us \u2013 but we have to use passwords anyway; and Matt Davey
            of 1Password, who offers a solution that Mozilla can get behind: use a
            password manager. A simple, game-changing tool that will help you take
            back control of your accounts, and secure yourself as best as you can.\n\nIRL

            campaigns in the age of screens. Two years later, Veronica Belmont and
            Baratunde Thurston examine how the internet is changing our minds, our
            votes, and our democracies \u2013 all over the world.\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning
            New York Times reporter Scott Shane details the United States' long history
            with election meddling. Paris correspondent for the Washington Post, James
            McAuley, shines a light on how other countries are managing the changing
            dynamics of online political campaigns. And speculative fiction authors
            Malka Older and Genevieve Valentine describe what elections may look like
            in the future, with advances in technology.\n\nIRL is an original podcast

          content: "Our online life is real life. We walk, talk, work, LOL and even
            love on the Internet \u2013 but we don\u2019t always treat it like real

            the wilds of the Web \u2013 and gets to the bottom of online issues that
            affect us all. Whether it\u2019s privacy breaches, closed platforms, hacking,
            fake news, or cyber bullying, we the people have the power to change the
            course of the Internet, keeping it healthy, weird, and wonderful for everyone.\n"

            The Internet (at least in the US) is at a crossroads as the FCC is considering rolling back the net neutrality regulations it adopted in 2015.  If net neutrality is abolished, the Internet could shift from an essential service that all consumers can access to a product that can be packaged and sold to the highest bidders. Get to know the potential winners and losers on both sides of the issue.

            What is life like without fast Internet, and how does life change once a person has it? Should Internet access be a right, rather than a luxury? Veronica Belmont explores these questions as she talks to people about joining the digital economy.

            to pull to get their site launched \u2014 and counter the sexist attitudes
            they fought against along the way. Brenda Darden Wilkerson recalls her
            life in tech in the 80s and 90s and shares her experience leading AnitaB.org,

            but also, the story of the birth of Hulu, which I don't think has really
            been covered anywhere before.

            For some reason, CheapShow asked a YouTube Retro Gamer and Digitiser The Show co-host to come on the podcast. And for some reason, she said yes. So, as a result, this is that episode! Please welcome Octav1ous Kitten to the show!

            Paul and Eli welcome her to the CheapShow Family in the only way they know how, by giving her dodgy presents, causing her to choke on milky powder, constantly getting her name wrong, offering her a suspicious Columbian import, dealing with Eli's wrath and literally getting her to split her trousers with laughter. No one deserves that.

            Oh and yes, there is also another Winkie update! The Winkie Rabbit hole gets deeper by the week... Somehow.

            it feels like a lot of media companies are giving up on this work altogether
            and outsourcing it to social media platforms \u2014 but that means foregoing
            some of the most powerful aspects of the internet. This week, we're joined

            online communities and not relying on Facebook."

          content: There has long been anxiety around the "permanent record" of the
            internet, and recent public shamings based on old tweets have brought
            that fear to the forefront for many people. But the mass deletion of old
            tweets also means throwing out huge amounts of potentially valuable information.
            Is there a technological solution? A cultural one? This week, we're joined
            by returning guests Cathy Gellis and Parker Higgins to discuss a proposal
            for fixing the problem without sacrificing the permanent record.

            to long-term innovation? It's a tough question, but there are plenty of
            reasons to consider that short-term profit incentives might be getting
            in the way of better overall innovation strategies \u2014 and lots of
            possibilities for how we might rethink companies to change this. This
            week, the regular crew of Mike, Hersh and Dennis discuss how this problem
            could be addressed, and whether there's truly a problem at all."

          author: Techdirt
          content: "The tides of public opinion on economics seem to be shifting,
            and criticism of the very idea of free markets is on the ride. The conversation
            is messy, confusing, and transcends many traditional political boundaries
            \u2014 so we've got an expert source to help us dig in. EconTalk host
            Russ Roberts joins us to look at why so many people don't trust capitalism
            anymore."

            Don't worry, most people haven't. But they are myriad and interesting,
            with roots nearly two decades ago following the emergence of emoticons
            \u2014 and two people who definitely have thought a lot about it are Eric

            at Our Bipolar Free Speech Disorder And How To Fix It (check out part
            one, part two, and part three). But with a topic like this, there's always
            more to dig into, so this week we've got Mike Godwin joining the podcast
            to take a closer look at his ideas about free speech in the digital era.

          content: By now, there's a good chance you've received an invitation to
            join Initiative Q, and also a good chance that you took one look at it
            and thought "wow, this seems extremely sketchy." And indeed, there's little
            reason (other than hopefulness) to see the strange new proposed payment
            system as anything but a pyramid scheme. But it's got people talking,
            thanks in no small part to its viral marketing scheme, so this week's
            episode is all about trying to figure out just what Initiative Q really
            is.

            a lot of complicated questions about free speech, privacy, and important
            rights. One person who's been thinking a lot about these questions is
            David Kaye, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection
            of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, who recently published
            a thorough report [pdf] on the subject. This week, David joins us on the
            podcast to discuss artificial intelligence and its implications for human
            rights.

          content: A major insurance company recently announced that it would offer
            discounts on life insurance to customers who wear activity trackers and
            log data showing they live a healthy lifestyle. This understandably freaked
            out some people, but there are interesting aspects to the idea as well.
            There's plenty to consider, so this week regular hosts Mike, Hersh and
            Dennis discuss whether this is an exciting innovation, a worrying expansion
            of surveillance culture, or both.

            platforms that fail to do the impossible. This week, we're joined by returning

          content: "Anonymity is back in the news in a big way, especially since the
            New York Times published an explosive opinion piece by an anonymous White
            House official. Here at Techdirt \u2014 proudly one of the few blogs that
            still allows completely anonymous comments with no sign-up \u2014 we've
            talked about anonymity for a long time in the context of the internet.
            On this week's episode, Mike and regular co-hosts Dennis Yang and Hersh
            Reddy talk about the benefits, challenges, and overall importance of anonymous
            speech."

          name: How Private Agreements Recreated SOPA
          author: Techdirt
          content: One of the most dangerous aspects of SOPA and other copyright proposals
            is the idea of moving enforcement and liability further down the stack
            of technology that powers the internet, even all the way to the DNS system.
            Although SOPA's DNS-blocking proposals were heavily criticized and the
            bill ultimately defeated, the idea of deep-level copyright enforcement
            has lived on and been implemented without changes to the law. This week
            our returning guest, law professor Annemarie Bridy, discusses how private
            agreements have quietly recreated some of the worst aspects of SOPA.

          author: Brian McCullough
          content: Ok, part 2 of the Stephan Paternot mega-episode right now. This
            is where we get into the meat of it, the good stuff, the whole crazy roller
            coaster ride of being the hottest startup of the dotcom era. And I was
            going to make this the last episode, but as I was editing this, I realized
            that after we get done with this story, Stephan talks a lot about what
            happens after... what happens after you've been on a crazy ride like this.
            How you have to reinvent yourself, and your life, and your career. He
            said so many interesting things about that, that for the first time ever,
            we're going to do a part 3, coming in two weeks, to talk about the reinvention.
