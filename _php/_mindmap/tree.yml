      overview: 'The Commonwealth spanned three galaxies and a myriad of cultures.
        Dylan Hunt, captain of the star ship Andromeda, was frozen in time and awoke
        three centuries later to find the Commonwealth had fallen. To fight back the
        chaos among the stars, Hunt must use the Andromeda to restore the Commonwealth
        and bring unity to the galaxy once again. He recruits a mercenary, Tyr Anasazi,
        and the crew of the Eureka Maru: Captain Beka Valentine, Engineer Seamus Harper,
        Physicist Rev Bem, and Medical Officer Trance Gemini. After discovering the
        Spirit of the Abyss and its powerful weapon, the Magog Worldship, the need
        for the Commonwealth is greater than ever. 50 member worlds are finally recruited,
        and the reconstruction of the Commonwealth is finally truly underway. More
        and more worlds sign on, contributing their fleets to protect each other.
        In the third season, Dylan and the crew travel from world to world as instructed
        by the Triumvirate, the leaders of the Commonwealth. But everything is building
        to the moment from one of his crew will betray him. The fourth year deals
        with the corruption of the Commonwealth after the recent betrayal. Things
        become more intense as the Andromeda is expelled from the Commonwealth, Trance
        reveals her true form, Harper holds a weapon capable of destroying the Commonwealth,
        Beka becomes possessed by the Spirit of the Abyss, and a new crew member joins.
        But the Magog Worldship is nearing, and the final confrontation is to protect
        a Utopian society from it.'
