## The Question ##

I am looking for a Image formate that has the following features:

 * Incremental updates[^1]: / Progressive Transmission
 * roll-back
 * lossy and lossless support

NASA / Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)

## image formates ##

thes image formates may support what I am looking for:

 * MrSID
 * JPEG 2000
 * ECW (Enhanced Compression Wavelet)
 * ICER
 * Progressive Graphics File


### MrSID ###

 * [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MrSID)
 * no open-source code :(
 * no usefully information :(
 * Has patented by LizardTech 
 * Originated as the result of research efforts at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).

### JPEG 2000 ###

### ECW (Enhanced Compression Wavelet) ###

### ICER ###

### Progressive Graphics File ###

 * looks like the best file formate
 * but the source code is unbuildable :(

> An incremental backup is a backup of latest changes since the last backup (any level) so that when a full recovery is needed the restoration process would need the last full backup plus all the incremental backups until the point-in-time of the restoration.[5] Incremental backups are often desirable as they consume minimum storage space and are quicker to perform than differential backups.[6] The purpose of an incremental backup is to preserve and protect data by creating copies that are based on the differences in those data and thus minimize the amount of time needed to perform the backup. With incremental backups, successive copies of the data contain only that portion that has changed since the preceding backup copy was made.
