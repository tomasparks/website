- title: "External Memory Management and Simplification of Huge Meshes"
  authors: P. Cignoni, C. Montani, C. Rocchini, R. Scopigno
  Abstract: "Very large triangle meshes, i.e. meshes composed of millions of faces, are becoming common in many
applications. Obviously, processing, rendering, transmission
and archival of these meshes are not simple tasks. Mesh simplification and LOD management are a rather mature technology that in many cases can efficiently manage complex
data. But only few available systems can manage meshes
characterized by a huge size: RAM size is often a severe
bottleneck. In this paper we present a data structure called Octree-based External Memory Mesh (OEMM ). It supports external memory management of complex meshes, loading dynamically in main memory only the selected sections and
preserving data consistency during local updates. The functionalities implemented on this data structure (simplification, detail preservation, mesh editing, visualization and inspection) can be applied to huge triangles meshes on low-
cost PC platforms. The time overhead due to the external memory management is affordable. Results of the test of our system on complex meshes are presented."

- title: "Spatial Data Structures For Accelerated 3D Visibility Computation To Enable Large Model Visualization On The Web."
  authors: Christian Stein, Max Limper, Arjan Kuijper
  Abstract: "The visualization of massive 3D models is an intensively examined field of research. Due to their rapidly growing complexity of
such models, visualisation them in real-time will never be possible
through a higher speed of rasterization alone. Instead, a practical
solution has to reduce the amount of data to be processed, using a
fast visibility determination.
In recent years, the combination of Javascript and WebGL raised
attention for the possibility of rendering hardware-accelerated 3D
graphics directly in the browser. However, when compared to desk-
top applications, they are still fighting with their disadvantages of a
generally slower execution speed, or a downgraded set of functionality.
We demonstrate the integration of spatial data structures, computed
on the client side, using latest technology trends to mitigate the
shortcomings of the 3D Web environment. We employ comparably
small bounding volume hierarchies to accelerate our visibility determination, as well as to enable specific culling techniques. This
allows for an interactive visualization of such massive 3D data sets.
Our in-depth analysis of different data structures and environments
shows which combination of data structure and visibility determination techniques are currently the best fit for the Web."
