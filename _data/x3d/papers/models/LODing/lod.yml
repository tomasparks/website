  Abstract: "Very large triangle meshes, i.e. meshes com-
posed of millions of faces, are becoming common in many
applications. Obviously, processing, rendering, transmission
and archival of these meshes are not simple tasks. Mesh sim-
plification and LOD management are a rather mature tech-
nology that in many cases can efficiently manage complex
data. But only few available systems can manage meshes
characterized by a huge size: RAM size is often a severe
bottleneck.
In this paper we present a data structure called Octree-
based External Memory Mesh (OEMM ). It supports exter-
nal memory management of complex meshes, loading dy-
namically in main memory only the selected sections and
preserving data consistency during local updates. The func-
tionalities implemented on this data structure (simplifica-
tion, detail preservation, mesh editing, visualization and in-
spection) can be applied to huge triangles meshes on low-
cost PC platforms. The time overhead due to the external
memory management is affordable. Results of the test of
our system on complex meshes are presented."
