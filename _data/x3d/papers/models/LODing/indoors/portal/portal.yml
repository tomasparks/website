  Abstract: "We present a system for rendering very complex 3D models at
interactive rates. We select a subset of the model as preferred
viewpoints and partition the space into virtual cells. Each cell
contains near geometry, rendered using levels of detail and
visibility culling, and far geometry, rendered as a textured depth
mesh. Our system automatically balances the screen-space errors
resulting from geometric simplification with those from textured-
depth-mesh distortion. We describe our prefetching and data
management schemes, both crucial for models significantly larger
than available system memory. We have successfully used our
system to accelerate walkthroughs of a 13 million triangle model
of a large coal-fired power plant and of a 1.7 million triangle
architectural model. We demonstrate the walkthrough of a 1.3 GB
power plant model with a 140 MB cache footprint."
