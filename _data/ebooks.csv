"Curtis, Keith Cary","Keith Cary Curtis","Computers are an advancement whose importance is comparable to the invention of the wheel or movable type. While computers and the Internet have already changed many aspects of our lives, we still live in the dark ages of computing because proprietary software is still the dominant model. One might say that the richest alchemist who ever lived is my former boss, Bill Gates. (Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are close behind.) Human knowledge increasingly exists in digital form, so building new and better models requires the software to be improved. People can only share ideas when they also share the software to display and modify them. It is the expanded use of free software that will allow a greater ability for people to work together and increase the pace of progress. This book will demonstrate that a system where anyone can edit, share, and review the body of work will lead not just to something that works, but eventually to the best that the world can achieve! With better cooperation among our scientists, robot-driven cars is just one of the many inventions that will arrive -- pervasive robotics, artificial intelligence, and much faster progress in biology, all of which rely heavily on software. - Publisher.

"Fisher, Gordon","Gordon Fisher","Learn 3D printing using the free open-source Blender software. This book gives you both an overview and practical instructions, enabling you to learn how to scale, build, color, and detail a model for a 3D printer.

**Overview**

  * Design beautiful, colourful, and practical objects in Blender to print or export 
  * Master Blender's special 3D printing tools to maximize print quality and minimize cost 
  * Consider requirements unique to 3D printing such as structural integrity and stability 

**In Detail**

Like computing, 3D printing has been around for decades but it was expensive and was only used for making complex prototypes. Now, prices have dropped and third-party printing services such as Shapeways have become available, making the technology available to everyone. 

Blender is an open source modeling and animation program popular in the 3D printing community. 3D printing demands more of a modeler than animation or virtual reality. The model maker must engineer their model to work in the real world. They must keep in mind the particular needs of the materials and printers that they are planning to use to print their model. 

This practical guide gives Blender users all the information they need to design high-quality 3D printed objects. With a solid exploration of the 3D modeling process, design considerations for 3D printing, plus step-by-step exercises, you will soon be comfortable making 3D objects for real-world enjoyment. 

Starting with an overview of 3D printing, this guide moves onto to precision measurement, fixing problems in a 3D model, and how to make it light and strong enough for real-world use. 

You will learn how to scale, build, and detail a model for a 3D printer. You will learn to color and decorate it, as well as making parts precisely in the size you want them, so that multi-part objects fit together smoothly. You will also learn tips on saving money when you have printed your model. 

With the help of this guide, you will be able to complete your project and learn how to export the file so it is ready for a variety of 3D printers. 

**What you will learn from this book**

  * Understand how a 3D printer makes a 3D object 
  * Get an introduction to different types of 3D printers 
  * Explore the materials that can be used in a 3D printer 
  * Get to grips with precision modeling techniques in Blender 
  * Use Blender's Ruler/Protractor tool 
  * Unwrap a texture to fit a model 
  * Make a model watertight and manifold 
  * Design an object hollow using the Solidify modifier 
  * Export to STL and X3D files for printing

**Approach**

This book adopts a practical approach, with the use of step-by-step instructions to help guide readers. There are lots of screenshots covering each and every step needed to design a high-quality model in Blender for 3D printing. 

**Who this book is written for**

If you are a Blender user or someone who wants to use Blender to make 3D objects suitable for 3D printing, this book is ideal for you. You should already be comfortable with basic modeling in Blender - including using modifiers - although advanced skills are not required. All of the models that you will need are explored in-depth. This book does not assume that you will use any specific printer and teaches the general principles common to building models for most printers. It also gives you tips on discovering the requirements of the specific printer you will be using.

"Keathley, Elizabeth","Elizabeth Keathley","***Digital Asset Management: Content Architectures, Project Management, and Creating Order out of Media Chaos*** is for those who are planning a digital asset management system or interested in becoming digital asset managers. This book explains both the purpose of digital asset management systems and why an organization might need one. The text then walks readers step-by-step through the concerns involved in selecting, staffing, and maintaining a DAM. This book is dedicated to providing you with a solid base in the common concerns, both legal and technical, in launching a complex DAM capable of providing visual search results and workflow options. 

Containing sample job models, case studies, return on investment models, and quotes from many top digital asset managers, this book provides a detailed resource for the vocabulary and procedures associated with digital asset management. It can even serve as a field guide for system and implementation requirements you may need to consider. 

This book is not dedicated to the purchase or launch of a DAM; instead it is filled with the information you need in order to examine digital asset management and the challenges presented by the management of visual assets, user rights, and branded materials.  It will guide you through justifying the cost for deploying a DAM and how to plan for growth of the system in the future. This book provides the most useful information to those who find themselves in the bewildering position of formulating access control lists, auditing metadata, and consolidating information silos into a very new sort of workplace management tool – the DAM. 

The author, Elizabeth Ferguson Keathley, is a board member of the DAM Foundation and has chaired both the Human Resources and Education committees. Currently Elizabeth is working with the University of British Columbia and the DAM Foundation to establish the first official certificate program for Digital Asset Managers. She has written, taught, and been actively a part of conferences related to the arrangement, description, preservation and access of information for over ten years. Her ongoing exploration of digital asset management and its relationship to user needs can be followed at her homepage for Atlanta Metadata Authority : atlantametadata.com. 

### What you’ll learn

  * The difference between DAMs, CMSs, and WCMs 

  * How to identify the need for a DAM, and how to conduct a needs assessment

  * Why there is no single best DAM solution for every need
  * How to discuss servers, hosting, and storage with your vendors and IT staff
  * How to hire staff or create positions for digital asset managers
  * How to survey and appraise collections and systems for DAM integration
  * How a search engine within a DAM actually works
  * How to establish reportable metrics for you DAM, including ROI figures
  * How to migrate collections for digital preservation and protection
  * Why rights management and brand management are two sides of the same DAM coin
  * Why DAM workflows will change the modern workplace for the better

### Who this book is for

  * Anyone who creates, uses, or searches for visual information in digital form
  * Librarians and Archivists interested in the future of digital preservation and access
  * Information Science Students and Professionals
  * CIOs and CEOs of companies with a large volume of visual assets
  * IT staff who need to understand what digital asset managers do all day

"Levy, Steven","Steven Levy","This 25th anniversary edition of Steven Levy's classic book traces the exploits of the computer revolution's original hackers -- those brilliant and eccentric nerds from the late 1950s through the early '80s who took risks, bent the rules, and pushed the world in a radical new direction. With updated material from noteworthy hackers such as Bill Gates, Mark Zukerberg, Richard Stallman, and Steve Wozniak, *Hackers* is a fascinating story that begins in early computer research labs and leads to the first home computers. 

Levy profiles the imaginative brainiacs who found clever and unorthodox solutions to computer engineering problems. They had a shared sense of values, known as ""the hacker ethic,"" that still thrives today. *Hackers* captures a seminal period in recent history when underground activities blazed a trail for today's digital world, from MIT students finagling access to clunky computer-card machines to the DIY culture that spawned the Altair and the Apple II.

**Amazon.com Exclusive: The Rant Heard Round the World**   
**By Steven Levy**

Author Steven LevyWhen I began researching *Hacker*s--so many years ago that it’s scary--I thought I’d largely be chronicling the foibles of a sociologically weird cohort who escaped normal human interaction by retreating to the sterile confines of computers labs. Instead, I discovered a fascinating, funny cohort who wound up transforming human interaction, spreading a culture that affects our views about everything from politics to entertainment to business. The stories of those amazing people and what they did is the backbone of *Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution*. 

But when I revisited the book recently to prepare the 25th Anniversary Edition of my first book, it was clear that I had luckily stumbled on the origin of a computer (and Internet) related controversy that still permeates the digital discussion. Throughout the book I write about something I called The Hacker Ethic, my interpretation of several principles implicitly shared by true hackers, no matter whether they were among the early pioneers from MIT’s Tech Model Railroad Club (the Mesopotamia of hacker culture), the hardware hackers of Silicon Valley’s Homebrew Computer Club (who invented the PC industry), or the slick kid programmers of commercial game software. One of those principles was “Information Should Be Free.” This wasn’t a justification of stealing, but an expression of the yearning to know more so one could hack more. The programs that early MIT hackers wrote for big computers were stored on paper tapes. The hackers would keep the tapes in a drawer by the computer so anyone could run the program, change it, and then cut a new tape for the next person to improve. The idea of ownership was alien. 

This idea came under stress with the advent of personal computers. The Homebrew Club was made of fanatic engineers, along with a few social activists who were thrilled at the democratic possibilities of PCs. The first home computer they could get their hands on was 1975’s Altair, which came in a kit that required a fairly hairy assembly process. (Its inventor was Ed Roberts, an underappreciated pioneer who died earlier this year.) No software came with it. So it was a big deal when 19-year-old Harvard undergrad Bill Gates and his partner Paul Allen wrote a BASIC computer language for it. The Homebrew people were delighted with Altair BASIC, but unhappy that Gates and Allen charged real money for it. Some Homebrew people felt that their need for it outweighed their ability to pay. And after one of them got hold of a “borrowed” tape with the program, he showed up at a meeting with a box of copies (because it is so easy to make perfect copies in the digital age), and proceeded to distribute them to anyone who wanted one, gratis. 

This didn’t sit well with Bill Gates, who wrote what was to become a famous “Letter to Hobbyists,” basically accusing them of stealing his property. It was the computer-age equivalent to Luther posting the Ninety-Five Theses on the Castle Church. Gate’s complaints would reverberate well into the Internet age, and variations on the controversy persist. Years later, when another undergrad named Shawn Fanning wrote a program called Napster that kicked off massive piracy of song files over the Internet, we saw a bloodier replay of the flap. Today, issues of cost, copying and control still rage--note Viacom’s continuing lawsuit against YouTube and Google. And in my own business—journalism--availability of free news is threatening more traditional, expensive new-gathering. Related issues that also spring from controversies in *Hackers* are debates over the “walled gardens” of Facebook and Apple’s iPad. 

I ended the original *Hackers* with a portrait of Richard Stallman, an MIT hacker dedicated to the principle of free software. I recently revisited him while gathering new material for the 25th Anniversary Edition of *Hackers*, he was more hard core than ever. He even eschewed the Open Source movement for being insufficiently noncommercial. 

When I spoke to Gates for the update, I asked him about his 1976 letter and the subsequent intellectual property wars. “Don’t call it war,” he said. “Thank God we have an incentive system. Striking the right balance of how this should work, you know, there's going to be tons of exploration.” Then he applied the controversy to my own situation as a journalism. “Things are in a crazy way for music and movies and books,” he said. “Maybe magazine writers will still get paid 20 years from now. Who knows? Maybe you'll have to cut hair during the day and just write articles at night.” 

So Amazon.com readers, it’s up to you. Those who have not read *Hackers,*, have fun and be amazed at the tales of those who changed the world and had a hell of time doing it. Those who have previously read and loved *Hackers*, replace your beat-up copies, or the ones you loaned out and never got back, with this beautiful 25th Anniversary Edition from O’Reilly with new material about my subsequent visits with Gates, Stallman, and younger hacker figures like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. If you don’t I may have to buy a scissors--and the next bad haircut could be yours!

### Amazon.com Review

Steven Levy's classic book explains why the misuse of the word ""hackers"" to describe computer criminals does a terrible disservice to many important shapers of the digital revolution. Levy follows members of an MIT model railroad club--a group of brilliant budding electrical engineers and computer innovators--from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s. These eccentric characters used the term ""hack"" to describe a clever way of improving the electronic system that ran their massive railroad. And as they started designing clever ways to improve computer systems, ""hack"" moved over with them. These maverick characters were often fanatics who did not always restrict themselves to the letter of the law and who devoted themselves to what became known as ""The Hacker Ethic."" The book traces the history of hackers, from finagling access to clunky computer-card-punching machines to uncovering the inner secrets of what would become the Internet. This story of brilliant, eccentric, flawed, and often funny people devoted to their dream of a better world will appeal to a wide audience.

**

### Amazon.com Review

This is the granddaddy of all alien invasion stories, first published by H.G. Wells in 1898. The novel begins ominously, as the lone voice of a narrator tells readers that ""No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's..."" 

Things then progress from a series of seemingly mundane reports about odd atmospheric disturbances taking place on Mars to the arrival of Martians just outside of London. At first the Martians seem laughable, hardly able to move in Earth's comparatively heavy gravity even enough to raise themselves out of the pit created when their spaceship landed. But soon the Martians reveal their true nature as death machines 100-feet tall rise up from the pit and begin laying waste to the surrounding land. Wells quickly moves the story from the countryside to the evacuation of London itself and the loss of all hope as England's military suffers defeat after defeat. With horror his narrator describes how the Martians suck the blood from living humans for sustenance, and how it's clear that man is not being conquered so much a corralled. *--Craig E. Engler*

### From Library Journal

This edition of Wells's much disguised attack on British imperialism includes a scholarly introduction, a biographical preface and chronology of the author's life, maps of the Martian landing sites, and explanatory notes. A lot of extras for the price.
