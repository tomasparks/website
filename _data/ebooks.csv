"Curtis, Keith Cary","Keith Cary Curtis","Computers are an advancement whose importance is comparable to the invention of the wheel or movable type. While computers and the Internet have already changed many aspects of our lives, we still live in the dark ages of computing because proprietary software is still the dominant model. One might say that the richest alchemist who ever lived is my former boss, Bill Gates. (Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are close behind.) Human knowledge increasingly exists in digital form, so building new and better models requires the software to be improved. People can only share ideas when they also share the software to display and modify them. It is the expanded use of free software that will allow a greater ability for people to work together and increase the pace of progress. This book will demonstrate that a system where anyone can edit, share, and review the body of work will lead not just to something that works, but eventually to the best that the world can achieve! With better cooperation among our scientists, robot-driven cars is just one of the many inventions that will arrive -- pervasive robotics, artificial intelligence, and much faster progress in biology, all of which rely heavily on software. - Publisher.

"Fisher, Gordon","Gordon Fisher","Learn 3D printing using the free open-source Blender software. This book gives you both an overview and practical instructions, enabling you to learn how to scale, build, color, and detail a model for a 3D printer.

**Overview**

  * Design beautiful, colourful, and practical objects in Blender to print or export 
  * Master Blender's special 3D printing tools to maximize print quality and minimize cost 
  * Consider requirements unique to 3D printing such as structural integrity and stability 

**In Detail**

Like computing, 3D printing has been around for decades but it was expensive and was only used for making complex prototypes. Now, prices have dropped and third-party printing services such as Shapeways have become available, making the technology available to everyone. 

Blender is an open source modeling and animation program popular in the 3D printing community. 3D printing demands more of a modeler than animation or virtual reality. The model maker must engineer their model to work in the real world. They must keep in mind the particular needs of the materials and printers that they are planning to use to print their model. 

This practical guide gives Blender users all the information they need to design high-quality 3D printed objects. With a solid exploration of the 3D modeling process, design considerations for 3D printing, plus step-by-step exercises, you will soon be comfortable making 3D objects for real-world enjoyment. 

Starting with an overview of 3D printing, this guide moves onto to precision measurement, fixing problems in a 3D model, and how to make it light and strong enough for real-world use. 

You will learn how to scale, build, and detail a model for a 3D printer. You will learn to color and decorate it, as well as making parts precisely in the size you want them, so that multi-part objects fit together smoothly. You will also learn tips on saving money when you have printed your model. 

With the help of this guide, you will be able to complete your project and learn how to export the file so it is ready for a variety of 3D printers. 

**What you will learn from this book**

  * Understand how a 3D printer makes a 3D object 
  * Get an introduction to different types of 3D printers 
  * Explore the materials that can be used in a 3D printer 
  * Get to grips with precision modeling techniques in Blender 
  * Use Blender's Ruler/Protractor tool 
  * Unwrap a texture to fit a model 
  * Make a model watertight and manifold 
  * Design an object hollow using the Solidify modifier 
  * Export to STL and X3D files for printing

**Approach**

This book adopts a practical approach, with the use of step-by-step instructions to help guide readers. There are lots of screenshots covering each and every step needed to design a high-quality model in Blender for 3D printing. 

**Who this book is written for**

If you are a Blender user or someone who wants to use Blender to make 3D objects suitable for 3D printing, this book is ideal for you. You should already be comfortable with basic modeling in Blender - including using modifiers - although advanced skills are not required. All of the models that you will need are explored in-depth. This book does not assume that you will use any specific printer and teaches the general principles common to building models for most printers. It also gives you tips on discovering the requirements of the specific printer you will be using.

"Keathley, Elizabeth","Elizabeth Keathley","***Digital Asset Management: Content Architectures, Project Management, and Creating Order out of Media Chaos*** is for those who are planning a digital asset management system or interested in becoming digital asset managers. This book explains both the purpose of digital asset management systems and why an organization might need one. The text then walks readers step-by-step through the concerns involved in selecting, staffing, and maintaining a DAM. This book is dedicated to providing you with a solid base in the common concerns, both legal and technical, in launching a complex DAM capable of providing visual search results and workflow options. 

Containing sample job models, case studies, return on investment models, and quotes from many top digital asset managers, this book provides a detailed resource for the vocabulary and procedures associated with digital asset management. It can even serve as a field guide for system and implementation requirements you may need to consider. 

This book is not dedicated to the purchase or launch of a DAM; instead it is filled with the information you need in order to examine digital asset management and the challenges presented by the management of visual assets, user rights, and branded materials.  It will guide you through justifying the cost for deploying a DAM and how to plan for growth of the system in the future. This book provides the most useful information to those who find themselves in the bewildering position of formulating access control lists, auditing metadata, and consolidating information silos into a very new sort of workplace management tool – the DAM. 

The author, Elizabeth Ferguson Keathley, is a board member of the DAM Foundation and has chaired both the Human Resources and Education committees. Currently Elizabeth is working with the University of British Columbia and the DAM Foundation to establish the first official certificate program for Digital Asset Managers. She has written, taught, and been actively a part of conferences related to the arrangement, description, preservation and access of information for over ten years. Her ongoing exploration of digital asset management and its relationship to user needs can be followed at her homepage for Atlanta Metadata Authority : atlantametadata.com. 

### What you’ll learn

  * The difference between DAMs, CMSs, and WCMs 

  * How to identify the need for a DAM, and how to conduct a needs assessment

  * Why there is no single best DAM solution for every need
  * How to discuss servers, hosting, and storage with your vendors and IT staff
  * How to hire staff or create positions for digital asset managers
  * How to survey and appraise collections and systems for DAM integration
  * How a search engine within a DAM actually works
  * How to establish reportable metrics for you DAM, including ROI figures
  * How to migrate collections for digital preservation and protection
  * Why rights management and brand management are two sides of the same DAM coin
  * Why DAM workflows will change the modern workplace for the better

### Who this book is for

  * Anyone who creates, uses, or searches for visual information in digital form
  * Librarians and Archivists interested in the future of digital preservation and access
  * Information Science Students and Professionals
  * CIOs and CEOs of companies with a large volume of visual assets
  * IT staff who need to understand what digital asset managers do all day

**Overview**

  * See how many of jQuery's methods and properties are used in real situations. Covers jQuery 1.9. 
  * Learn to build jQuery from source files, write jQuery plugins, and use jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile.
  * Familiarise yourself with the latest related technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and frameworks like Knockout.js.

**In Detail**

jQuery is used by millions of people to write JavaScript more easily and more quickly. It has become the standard tool for web developers and designers to add dynamic, interactive elements to their sites, smoothing out browser inconsistencies and reducing costly development time.

jQuery Hotshot walks you step by step through 10 projects designed to familiarise you with the jQuery library and related technologies. Each project focuses on a particular subject or section of the API, but also looks at something related, like jQuery's official templates, or an HTML5 feature like localStorage. Build your knowledge of jQuery and related technologies.

Learn a large swathe of the API, up to and including jQuery 1.9, by completing the ten individual projects covered in the book.

Some of the projects that we'll work through over the course of this book include a drag-and-drop puzzle game, a browser extension, a multi-file drag-and-drop uploader, an infinite scroller, a sortable table, and a heat map.

Learn which jQuery methods and techniques to use in which situations with jQuery Hotshots.

**What you will learn from this book**

  * Learn how to use the latest version of jQuery (1.9) in real-world situations. 
  * Create a jQuery plugin structured for organisation and maintainability. 
  * Construct a custom version of jQuery using Node.js and Grunt.js, and learn how to run unit tests using qUnit. 
  * Build on top of online services like Google Maps to create interactive interfaces. 
  * Use templating frameworks to easily and efficiently create repetitive areas of the page populated with data. 
  * Get started with the related jQuery-powered frameworks jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile.
