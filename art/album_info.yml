  description: Constructive solid geometry (CSG) (formerly called computational binary
    solid geometry) is a technique used in solid modeling. Constructive solid geometry
    allows a modeler to create a complex surface or object by using Boolean operators
    to combine simpler objects.[1] Often CSG presents a model or surface that appears
    visually complex, but is actually little more than cleverly combined or decombined
    objects.
