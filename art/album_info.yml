  description: Constructive solid geometry (CSG) (formerly called computational binary
    solid geometry) is a technique used in solid modeling. Constructive solid geometry
    allows a modeler to create a complex surface or object by using Boolean operators
    to combine simpler objects.[1] Often CSG presents a model or surface that appears
    visually complex, but is actually little more than cleverly combined or decombined
    objects.

  description: Minecraft is a sandbox video game originally created by Swedish programmer
    Markus "Notch" Persson and later developed and published by Mojang. The creative
    and building aspects of Minecraft enable players to build constructions out of
    textured cubes in a 3D procedurally generated world.
