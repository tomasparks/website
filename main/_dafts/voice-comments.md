### Pre-History ###

Around 2007 I found [moodlespeex](https://www.google.com.au/search?&q=moodlespeex+site%3Amoodle.org) a java applet[^1] that would:

* record voice message
* compress the audio into the [speex codec](https://www.speex.org/)
* upload the audio

I ported it to wordpress around 2007 (source code lost to history :( ).


I looked at adobe flash when I found out it supported speex codec,
but at the time I all them need a [RTMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol) server to capture the audio.
