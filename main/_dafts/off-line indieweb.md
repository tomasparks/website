title: off-line indiewebing

I've been looking at Off-line Indiewebing for a while a recent [mircocast](#metions), got me thinking how it could be done?


my current setup off-line setup is 

* [psion 5 pda]() with a serial link and termail software
* Xbee (1Km) link
* [BBS]() software

I use a group of software on the pda

* email client (maildir)
* text editor
* database (CSV import/export)

### emails ###

I have not completed the 'sync' transfer mode yet




### Indieweb reader app ###



[jf2](http://microformats.org/wiki/jf2) files compress very well using [deflate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE),

but: 
* [Muxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing) the jf2 feeds together could be a [issue](^1:)
* [DeMuxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing) the jf2 feeds could be a [issue](^1:)


## long term ##

I belive indieweb is a starting point for moving onto the next generation of the internet known as Information-Centric-Network/Delay-Torrant-Networking Internet
