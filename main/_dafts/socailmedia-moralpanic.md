title: social media moral Panic
---

We have always had phobias (eg. xenophobia),
The Internet has made the world a global communtiy
Social media platforms have allowed our phobias to control us online.[^1]

We have become hyperseitive and react without any recard
and demanded third-parties solve our problems.

the third-parties have their own vettsed insterd and may not be aligned with our own.

I feel this moral panic is a smokescreen to our internal insecritys/phobias

Social media platforms have made the barrer to publish dirt cheap and with a captive auaices before social media platforms that barrer to publish was high[2] (time and money) and there was not garreted captive audaice.

[^1]: in the real world we have to hide our phobias, unless there was group the allowed us to express our phobias eg: [KKK]()

[^2]: 1990: settup a web host, domain and learn [HTML]().
1980: settup a computer and Modem, install BBS software.
1970 and early: type up a newsletter on a typewriter and photocopy it.
