tittl: electronics and me
---

I've had a group of bad expercences build electronics circuits

in the early 1990:
* I a build a few circuits from a beginer electroinc books
* at highschool i want to join electronic club, but the clubs teacher killed that dream

A few years ago: I relooked at getting back into electronics with the arduno starter kit, the LED lights requerements (polearty, restor) have killed it again for me

PS: I never wanted to learn how to solider, the [conductive paint]() looked like my best option.
PSS: I was also looking making my own circuit boards (PCB), I found [heat-transfers]{} methoid I also found [conductive ink pens]() that could use in my pen plotter
