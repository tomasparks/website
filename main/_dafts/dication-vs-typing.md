title: dictation vs typing
---

I am debating whether to use dictation vs typing

## Dictation ##

I been think about record what I say for a few years now

I've been looking a speech recogition on and of for years

* I brough speech recogition software for my windos 95 computer
* I got full version of drangon speech recogition software of a Cover CD[^1]
* I downloaded Windows Speech API 5.0 SDK

I tried them for about month before losing insret
as I hade nonething to say and I tiyed to a computer

I've been relooking at idea because of the cloud speech recogition options
from AWS and google

but I do a lot of my think in the bathroom and
I dont feel comfortable verbizing my thoughts 

### Sub-vocalization ###

a universte in aermica, 
[demoed](http://) a sub-vocail recogition setup,
that was used in public and looked like a comercial product

TAKE MY MONEY, NOW!

## typing ##

I prefer typing but I cant spell to save my life[^2]
