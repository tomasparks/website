I've been trying to archive [Pov-ray's Usenet](http://news.povray.org/groups/) for the last fornight, but it has been give me hell especially the binary groups witch have over 78,000+ articles in each group  

* restart the download process multiple times :(
* thuderbird keep crashing :(
* unsure if I downloaded all articles (so redownloading)

* one good thing is I am storing articles in maildir format :)
* compressing/archiving them with zpaq 



the Archiving well be give two project bang for their buck:

* TeamArchive
* my own DTN project
