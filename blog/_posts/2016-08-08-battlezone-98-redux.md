* I bought battlezone in the late 1990s or early 2000s it was in a DVD case for about AU$10
* I was able to get to Venus[^1][^2]

## Battlezone II ##

* I dont remeber when I bought BZII, I think it was in a DVD case for AU$10
* the graphics were a lot better, but the first three levels of the campagain sucked[^3]
* I would play Intenat action most of the time

### Scion IA: ###

* I was able to win once or twice on hard, until something changed ( bug??? )[^4]
* 


[^1]: After watching a [let's play](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7GvZV4nKhETa-gjnh3ulcHroD8G8ThUr) of battlezone, I realized I had screwed myself on the last Mars mission, by not distorying the CCA base
[^2]: It also seams that not all the start units are not suplyed if you fail the perous mission
[^3]: I did get to the fork in the campagain, tryed the Scion's first mission, gave up
[^4]: i dont know how the AI plays the Scion, cheats?
