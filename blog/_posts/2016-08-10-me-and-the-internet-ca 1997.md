# Get the modem #
* I went down to the local computer realiter to get a modem with my father
* I remeber pick up a US-Robotics 56k modem reading the description it include RealVideo[^1] software

# Getting Online #
* Realizing I did not get any starter kits with the modem, doh
* I got online with AOL[^2] (100 hour free), OzEmail (prepaid or free hours, not sure), Bigpond (pre-paid), Optus (pre-paid)

[^1]: I remeber read a dead-tree maganize: it had a article about Real's New [RealVideo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealVideo) Fractal Codec, I must of been in a trace
[^2]: When my mother got the telphone bill, the shit hit the fan as it was long distance phone call (charged by the mintue).
