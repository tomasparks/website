        For some reason, CheapShow asked a YouTube Retro Gamer and Digitiser The Show co-host to come on the podcast. And for some reason, she said yes. So, as a result, this is that episode! Please welcome Octav1ous Kitten to the show!

        Paul and Eli welcome her to the CheapShow Family in the only way they know how, by giving her dodgy presents, causing her to choke on milky powder, constantly getting her name wrong, offering her a suspicious Columbian import, dealing with Eli's wrath and literally getting her to split her trousers with laughter. No one deserves that.

        Oh and yes, there is also another Winkie update! The Winkie Rabbit hole gets deeper by the week... Somehow.
