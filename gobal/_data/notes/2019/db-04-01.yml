        The Downfall, The Rebirth, The Future of Podcasting, Money Matters, Why Do
        I Podcast. Just felt like putting down my thoughts and perspective on Podcasting,
        in advance of the Great Podcast Boom/Bust of 2019-2020. I podcast for a reason,
        and I re-iterate it in this episode: Because when looking to pay off debts,
        I wanted to also produce something beyond selling a shirt or doing a fundraiser
        with nothing else to come of it besides stasis. At 60 episodes, this is quite
        a body of work, and you''ve been inspirational in helping me create it.'
