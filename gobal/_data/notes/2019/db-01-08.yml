      author: Techdirt
      content: "Anonymity is back in the news in a big way, especially since the New
        York Times published an explosive opinion piece by an anonymous White House
        official. Here at Techdirt \u2014 proudly one of the few blogs that still
        allows completely anonymous comments with no sign-up \u2014 we've talked about
        anonymity for a long time in the context of the internet. On this week's episode,
        Mike and regular co-hosts Dennis Yang and Hersh Reddy talk about the benefits,
        challenges, and overall importance of anonymous speech."
