      name: Charter Cities & Innovative Governance
      author: Techdirt
      content: "We're pretty optimistic about innovation here at Techdirt, but it
        isn't an automatic good thing all by itself: implementation and intention
        matters, and that means political entanglements and complicated questions
        about governance, and that calls for big, new ideas. This week, we're joined
        by Tamara Winter from the Center for Innovative Governance Research to discuss
        new experiments in government like charter cities and special autonomous zones.\r\n\r\nAlso,
