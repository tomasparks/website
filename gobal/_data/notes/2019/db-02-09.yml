      name: Life Without The Tech Giants
      author: Techdirt
      content: 'One of the most common responses to various complaints about giant
        tech companies is that you can just not use their products and services. Many
        people have pointed out just how difficult that would really be, but Gizmodo''s
        Kashmir Hill decided to try it for real: she cut Amazon, Facebook, Google,
        Microsoft, and Apple out of her life for a week each, followed by a week without
        any of them. Her report on that final, empty week is coming out soon, but
        in the mean time she joins us on the podcast to talk about what it''s like
        to live without big tech.'

      name: The Grand Re-Opening Of The Public Domain
      author: Techdirt
      content: As our readers surely know by now, 2019 is the first time in a long
        time that new works have actually entered the public domain in the US! The
        Internet Archive and Creative Commons hosted a celebration of this fact, and
        this week we're joined by IA's Lila Bailey and CC's Timothy Vollmer to talk
        about that event and the exciting possibilities of a re-opened public domain.
