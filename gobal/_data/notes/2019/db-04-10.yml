      name: MEP Julia Reda Explains What's Next With The EU Copyright Directive
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Unfortunately, as you know by now, the EU Parliament approved the
        current (disastrous) version of the EU Copyright Directive, which is now on
        track to become the law of the land. It's not good, but things aren't quite
        over yet. For this week's episode, we've got returning guest MEP Julia Reda
        \u2014 who has been a key force opposing the terrible articles in the Directive
        \u2014 to talk about what happens now."
