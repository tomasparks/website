      name: 189. A Legal History of the Web Era With Richard Chapo
      author: Brian McCullough
      content: "It\u2019s bothered me for a while that over the 5 years or so of this
        podcast, we haven\u2019t focused very much on some corners of the history.
        For example\u2026 the legal side? Copyright law? Intellectual property law?
        How much have we talked about disruption and piracy and filesharing and all
        that stuff? So, I spoke to Richard Chapo, who has been doing Internet Law
        since the web went mainstream. We talk about the Napster era, we talk about
        how much of an influence the adult industry had on digital law, we talk about
        the state of digital law today, and actually, a whole bunch of contemtorary
        law stuff like GDPR."
