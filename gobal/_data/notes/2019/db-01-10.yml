      name: Old Tweets & Your Permanent Record
      author: Techdirt
      content: There has long been anxiety around the "permanent record" of the internet,
        and recent public shamings based on old tweets have brought that fear to the
        forefront for many people. But the mass deletion of old tweets also means
        throwing out huge amounts of potentially valuable information. Is there a
        technological solution? A cultural one? This week, we're joined by returning
        guests Cathy Gellis and Parker Higgins to discuss a proposal for fixing the
        problem without sacrificing the permanent record.

      name: There's Always Something New To Learn About Copyright
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Copyright is a big, complicated monster of a law, composed of patchwork
        updates and shaped by international agreements \u2014 which is, in fact, the
        source of a lot of its problems. But fixing copyright means understanding
        it, so this week we've got a conversation with UCLA professor Neil Netanel,
        author of the new book Copyright: What Everyone Needs To Know, because there's
        always something new to learn about copyright."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "The tides of public opinion on economics seem to be shifting, and
        criticism of the very idea of free markets is on the ride. The conversation
        is messy, confusing, and transcends many traditional political boundaries
        \u2014 so we've got an expert source to help us dig in. EconTalk host Russ
        Roberts joins us to look at why so many people don't trust capitalism anymore."

      content: "Have you ever thought about the legal issues surrounding emoji? Don't
        worry, most people haven't. But they are myriad and interesting, with roots
        nearly two decades ago following the emergence of emoticons \u2014 and two
        people who definitely have thought a lot about it are Eric Goldman and Gabriella
        Ziccarelli, who join us on this week's episode to talk about the various intersections
        of emoji and the law."

        a look at how people and businesses are dealing with innovation and rapid

      name: Do Short-Term Profits Hurt Long-Term Innovation?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Is the way companies are currently structured and operated conducive
        to long-term innovation? It's a tough question, but there are plenty of reasons
        to consider that short-term profit incentives might be getting in the way
        of better overall innovation strategies \u2014 and lots of possibilities for
        how we might rethink companies to change this. This week, the regular crew
        of Mike, Hersh and Dennis discuss how this problem could be addressed, and
        whether there's truly a problem at all."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "One thing we've talked about for a long time at Techdirt is the importance
        communities for media outlets, including our own. These days, it feels like
        a lot of media companies are giving up on this work altogether and outsourcing
        it to social media platforms \u2014 but that means foregoing some of the most
        powerful aspects of the internet. This week, we're joined by Josh Millard,
        who recently took over MetaFilter, to talk about building online communities
        and not relying on Facebook."
