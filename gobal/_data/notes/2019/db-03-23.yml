      content: "The Acting Episode: Johannes and a Restaurant, Electricity and Christmas
        Lights, Acting, Pages, Out of Order, Tourist Trap, Editing. The Wikipedia
        entry for the film is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Je_Suis_Auto\_ While
        editing up the episode, I'm not 100% sure I make clear that the primary director
        of the \"Je Suis Auto\" film is Juliana Neuhuber (https://www.juliananeuhuber.com/)
        and Johannes is co-director but mostly in the role of main actor and writer.
        Johannes (and I and others) had ideas but Juliana was the final word on set.
        The casino/tourist trap I mentioned is called Excalibur City and the home
        page for it is here: http://www.excaliburcity.com/en/ \_"

      name: The Failure Of High Tech Policing
      author: Techdirt
      content: 'Sometimes people ask us why we write so much about the police on Techdirt.
        Though our coverage has grown somewhat beyond the boundaries of incidents
        directly involving technology, the reality is that the problems with law enforcement
        persistently intersect with the same technological and legal issues we''ve
        always discussed here. But this week the focus is squarely on cops and technology:
        Mike is joined by Matt Stroud, author of the new book Thin Blue Lie, as well
        as our own Tim Cushing, to talk about the failure of high-tech policing.'

      name: Your Password is the Worst
      author: Mozilla
      content: "Look, we agree with you: passwords are the worst. But you know what
        else is the worst? Someone hacking your account, or big security breaches
        that expose your email, your credit card information, your government-issued
        identification number, and more. We should hold companies accountable for
        better security, but we also need to hold ourselves accountable for having
        good password hygiene. So let's tackle this once and for all. Hear from Buzzfeed's
        Mat Honan, who endured a brutal hack a few years ago when hackers exploited
        password-recovery tools; Mark Wilson from Fast Company, who wants to ban passwords
        altogether (though admits it's not the best idea); Masha Sedova of Elevate
        Security who says that, yes, security companies have failed us \u2013 but
        we have to use passwords anyway; and Matt Davey of 1Password, who offers a
        solution that Mozilla can get behind: use a password manager. A simple, game-changing
        tool that will help you take back control of your accounts, and secure yourself
        as best as you can.\n\nIRL is an original podcast from Mozilla. For more on
        the series go to irlpodcast.org\n"

      name: Checking Out Online Shopping
      author: Mozilla
      content: "When you shop, your data may be the most valuable thing for sale.
        This isn\u2019t just true online \u2014 your data follows you into brick and
        mortar stores now as well. Manoush Zomorodi explores the hidden costs of shopping,

        Amazon captures about you when you make an online purchase; Joseph Turow,
        who discusses how retailers are stripping us of our privacy; and Alana Semuels,
        who talks about becoming a hoarder with the advent of online shopping. Plus,

      author: Mozilla
      content: "The 2016 U.S. presidential election blew up our ideas about influence
        campaigns in the age of screens. Two years later, Veronica Belmont and Baratunde
        Thurston examine how the internet is changing our minds, our votes, and our
