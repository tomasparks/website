      content: "We\u2019re live on the scene the day following the biggest announcement
        in the open source software world since well, open source software: Microsoft
        acquiring GitHub for $7.5B in stock. How did we get here? What does it mean
        for software developers going forward? And most importantly, why is there
        a creepy half-cat / half-octopus plastered all over everything? As always,
        Acquired has the answers. "

      content: "If you thought the telecom business was boring, think again! Acquired
        brings you an episode packed with more drama than an entire season of Game
        of Thrones. Starting with a death in the family, we follow a tale of fortunes
        lost and rebuilt, bitter battles between rivals who once worked for each other,
        and at the center of it all, a lesson in the power of stable cashflow businesses.

      name: Are E-Scooters A Problem?
      author: Techdirt
      content: The latest entrant on the decentralized transportation scene is the
        suddenly-ubiquitous electric scooters that are taking over San Francisco and
        other cities. Their appearance has triggered the inevitable controversy, with
        some saying they are ruining cities while others laud their convenience for
        urbanites. And, of course, a regulatory battle wasn't far behind. On this
        week's episode, we discuss the e-scooter trend and its many pros and cons.
