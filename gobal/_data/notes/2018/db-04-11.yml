      name: Can The Blockchain Save Publishers?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "After the recent launch of po.et, which aims to use the blockchain
        to create a new business model for digital media companies, Mike was... unconvinced.
        This led to a Twitter discussion with CEO Jarrod Dicker, which in turn led
        to a longer in-person conversation about the ideas behind the service and
        where it might go \u2014 and you can listen to the whole thing on this week's
        podcast episode."
