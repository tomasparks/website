      content: 'The User Group Episode: Mark''s Childhood Flight Simulator, 48 hours,
        User Groups, RIAG, CACHE, Finding Cohorts, Emulation Casualties, The Darkest
        Outlook.  Some thoughts on user groups and software, all based on a pretty
        good success story trying to find a flight simulator for a co-worker. All
        ending in a natural place: the inherent existential threat of technology.
        Thanks everyone who has been supporting me this whole time, by the way. It''s
        taken such a load off.'

      content: 'The Amateur Episode: Question Not Question, Stumbling into Librarian,
        Emerson College, Zero Sum Games, The Early Web, TEXTFILES.COM as Library,
        Your Amateur Moment. I''ve tried to take a (minor) sour moment and turn it
        into something positive. I also got to give some thoughts on some generalized
        criticisms that are usually subtweeted in my direction, although how much
        this episode moves the needle, I''ll likely never know.  The presentation,
        by the way, was a lot of fun and I got to meet some really great folks who
        I''d never had the chance to meet. I found out about some long-memory examples
        held up in in the professional spheres, and I hope to research those to have
        what other lessons could have learned. Also, lunch was amazing and someone
        handed me a stack of hard drives.  Also, now you know why "Rank Amateur" is
        in my twitter bio!'

        are three podcasts being posted today. I''m keeping to 4 a month and I just
        got hit with a lot of commitments and project work that took me away from
        recording. I also recorded an episode while I was in California that had sound
        so terrible I just had to try again.  This one''s about one of my favorite
        letters I ever got, as well as thoughts on creating games then and now, and
        the benefits of each. I love creative tools so much!'
