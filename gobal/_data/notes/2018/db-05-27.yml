      author: Techdirt
      content: "We've talked before about how the very nature of work is changing
        thanks to technology, with telecommuting being an obvious trend \u2014 but
        despite some early predictions about the death of the physical office, the
        reality is offices have been evolving and changing thanks to technology and
        innovation too. This week, we discuss co-working spaces and other trends in
        the evolution of offices."

      name: The Truth About VPNs
      author: Techdirt
      content: "For a long time now, \"use a VPN\" has been the default online privacy
        advice \u2014 but is it really so effective? Following the recent VPN boom
        that came on the tails of Congress scrapping new ISP privacy rules, a few
        security experts have stepped forward to explain how VPNs aren't all they're
        cracked up to be, and choosing and using one isn't as easy as many articles
        and social media posts suggest. Among them are this week's guests, Kevin Riggle
        (who provided a quick and dirty primer with the key suggestion that most people
        are safer not using a VPN) and Kenn White (who assembled a list of VPNs he
        deems \"terrible\" and not without good reason, recommending a roll-your-own
        solution instead). They join us to dig deeper into the reality of VPNs and
        hopefully help some people make better choices."

      name: The End Of Ownership
      author: Techdirt
      content: 'The basic impetus behind DRM is obvious: a frantic, misguided desire
        to make digital products behave like physical ones. But the truth is DRM goes
        far, far beyond that, restricting all sorts of activities that are intrinsic
        to the idea of "owning" something. Two people who have thought a lot about
        this are law professors Aaron Perzanowski and Jason Schultz, authors of the
        new book The End Of Ownership. This week, Aaron and Jason join the podcast
        to discuss the book and the worrying status of DRM today.'

      name: Why This ISP Supports Net Neutrality, Privacy Rules And More
      author: Techdirt
      content: Since Congress threw out new privacy rules for ISPs that were supposed
        to come into effect soon, there's been a renewed uproar on all sides of the
        debate about internet regulation. While the big ISPs generally want to be
        able to do as they please, there are smaller service providers out there that
        fully understand and embrace the need for privacy, net neutrality and more.
        One such ISP is Sonic, and this week we're joined by CEO Dane Jasper to discuss
        why these rules are a good thing.

      name: Does Pharma Really Need Patents?
      author: Techdirt
      content: 'It doesn''t take many stories of people suffering due to unaffordable
        medicine to make you question the state of pharmaceutical patents, but the
        arguments in their defense are loud and frequent. Most are variations on the
        same theme: without the promise of a monopoly, important drugs would never
        be researched and developed. But does this argument truly hold up? It''s come
        up as a tangent in previous episodes of the podcast, but this week we''re
        dedicating a full episode to questioning the popular defenses of pharma patents
        and looking for a better way forward.'

        known as \"the father of information theory.\" In the pantheon of cool people
        who made the modern information era possible, he\u2019s right up there. Today,
        we\u2019re going to talk to the authors of a great biography of the man called
        A Mind At Play, How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age. Especially
        you software engineers out there, if you don\u2019t know who Claude Shannon
        was, get educated. You owe your livelihood to this man."
