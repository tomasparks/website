      content: "Acquired dives into the topic on the minds and lips of just about
        every VC and founder these days: SoftBank\u2019s $93B+ Vision Fund, and its
        seemingly-overnight rewriting of the rules of venture capital and startup
        fundraising. Where did this new 800lbs gorilla come from, what are its goals,
        and what does it mean for the future of silicon valley and the global tech
        ecosystem? The answer, it turns out, starts with an acquisition, and unfolds
        into a story no one has yet told and few yet understand. Luckily our heroes
        are on the case!"

      name: Is Facebook Moderation A Necessary Evil?
      author: Techdirt
      content: Facebook's efforts to moderate content that appears on the social network
        have run into numerous problems, most recently with a famous war photo and
        a bunch of blog posts. Some have made absurd demands in response, such as
        giving old-school media editors special posting privileges, while others have
        objected to the idea of Facebook censoring any content whatsoever. But is
        that objection realistic? This week, we discuss the complicated question of
        Facebook moderation, and what the company's role can and should be.

      author: Techdirt
      content: "As technology ushers more and more things towards the realm of \"post-scarcity\",
        an inevitable conversation has arisen around the very roots of capitalism
        and what this rapid change means for our economic systems at the most fundamental
        levels. But the answer is far from simple \u2014 is capitalism dying? Can
        it evolve? Is the whole question being framed incorrectly? This week, we discuss
        the notion of a post-capitalist world, what it might look like, and how close
        it actually is."

      name: Inside A Really Good Kickstarter Campaign
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Not all Kickstarter campaigns are created equal. Even the mostly-good
        ones that eventually satisfy their backers are often plagued with delays and
        poor communication. But once in a while, there's a campaign that runs smoothly,
        communicates openly, and delivers a great product on time as promised \u2014
        and Minaal is one company that pulled off such a campaign to launch its line
        of travel bags. This week, we're joined by co-founder Jimmy Hayes to discuss
        how they pulled it off and what their experience can teach us about other
        campaigns and the broader crowdfunding ecosystem."

      author: Techdirt
      content: Gawker's gone, and that's that. And yet, whenever we've expressed concerns
        over the billionaire vendetta that brought it down, we've faced a huge amount
        of pushback from people who had problems with the site and its reporting practices.
        This week, we're joined by Parker Thompson aka Startup L. Jackson for a friendly
        debate about whether the Gawker shutdown really is a big deal.

        and, most recently, taking up the defense of Kickass Torrents operator Artem
        Vaulin. This week, Ira joins us on the podcast to discuss the ins and outs
        of these and other cases where the entertainment industry has come down hard
        on consumers and innovators.

      author: Techdirt
      content: 'The internet is built on a solid foundation of open protocols: TCP/IP,
        HTTP and SMTP especially, plus more modern entrants like RSS and BitTorrent.
        But even those aren''t so new anymore, and it seems like the era of the open
        protocol might be coming to an end, supplanted by the drive to create proprietary
        closed platforms. This week, we discuss whether the open protocol is dead,
        and what that means for the future of the open internet.'

        I join this week's episode myself as a guest host, and in truth none of us
        really think it's any kind of \"apocalypse\" \u2014 but none of us are huge
        fans of the move either. We discuss the questionable technical advantages,
        the looming spectre of DRM, and more."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "Edward Snowden deserves a pardon. We all know it \u2014 even if you
        believe he deserves to stand trial, the only option right now is an unfair
        trial on Espionage Act charges in which he'd be blocked from presenting a
        meaningful defense. A pardon from those charges is the only just choice. This
        week, we're joined by Trevor Timm, co-founder of the Freedom Of The Press
        Foundation, and returning guest Parker Higgins to discuss why Edward Snowden
        deserves a pardon, and the campaign to get him one deserves your support."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "Data breaches that expose passwords are pretty much a fact of life
        at this point \u2014 and the effects are multiplied by the fact that many,
        many people reuse passwords no matter how much they know they shouldn't. As
        such, there's a big push to move to password managers, two-factor authentication,
        and even biometrics \u2014 because the simple fact is the password sucks.
        This week, we're discussing what if anything will succeed in replacing it."

      author: Techdirt
      content: We wanted to do an episode all about examining the tech policy platforms
        of the 2016 presidential candidates, but that proved impossible since one
        candidate's is vague and noncommittal while the other's doesn't exist at all.
        Since a nuanced discussion about robust tech policy platforms was probably
        a bit much to hope for from this election anyway, for this week's episode
        we're discussing what a great presidential tech platform should look like
        under less absurd circumstances.
