      author: Adam Ruins Everything
      content: "While they may sport perfectly manicured lawns and beautiful white
        picket fences, suburbs are not the idyllic neighborhoods we think they are.
        They make us more sedentary, sometimes less safe, and they can even perpetuate
        segregation. But instead of leaving the suburbs we can actually address these
        issues and improve our suburbs through redevelopment and retrofitting neighborhoods
        to make them greener, healthier, safer and more affordable. Our guest Ellen
        Dunham-Jones, who appeared on Adam Ruins the Suburbs, tells us all about it.
        She has spent her career studying how suburbs can adapt to these 21st century
        challenges. Ellen is a leading authority on suburban redevelopment and is
        the Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at Georgia Tech.\r\n\r\nAdam
