        Who Made the Internet
      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: "Claire Evans is the author of the new book: Broad Band The Untold
        Story of the Women Who Made the Internet. This is the best tech history book
        I\u2019ve read in a while and you know I read them all. Of special note, considering
        our 90s-heavy focus on this podcast, the book includes the stories of Word.com,
        which was a competitor to Feed.com (which we\u2019ve previously covered) and
        Women.com which was a competitor to Ivillage (which, again, we\u2019ve spoke
        at length about). "

      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: 'No joke, this is one of my favorite episodes we''ve ever done. Eugene
        Wei was an early employee at Hulu, so we get some details on that company
        for the first time, and he also worked at Flipboard and Oculus, so we get
        some important context especially on the future of VR and the like. But the
        most fascinating stories you''ll hear will be about Amazon, where Eugene was
        the first analyst in the strategic planning department. As you''ll hear, Eugene
