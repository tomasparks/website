      author: Techdirt
      content: "It wasn't very long ago that we last discussed SESTA on the podcast,
        but now that the House has voted to approve its version of the bill with SESTA
        tacked on, it's unfortunately time to dig into the issues again. So this week
        we're joined by returning guest Emma Llans\xF3 from the Center for Democracy
        and Technology and, for the first time, law professor Eric Goldman to talk
        about why the combination of SESTA and FOSTA has resulted in the worst of
        both worlds."
