      author: The Planetary Society
      content: "The New Horizons mission was a triumph, revealing Pluto as an utterly
        unique and beautiful world. But the mission first had to survive challenge
        after challenge, fighting to be developed, meeting a nearly impossible launch
        deadline, and then narrowly avoiding disaster when it was barely a week from
        its destination. The entire dramatic tale has now been told by Principal Investigator
        Alan Stern and his co-author, astrobiologist David Grinspoon.&nbsp; They join
        Mat Kaplan to talk about their book, Chasing New Horizons\u2014Inside the
        Epic First Mission to Pluto.&nbsp; A signed copy of the book will go to the
        winner of this episode\u2019s space trivia contest.&nbsp; Emily Lakdawalla
        has returned from an international gathering of Mercury scientists with a
        special report.&nbsp; The Planetary Society\u2019s Senior Editor also marks
        the launch of a Chinese lunar orbiter.&nbsp; Learn more about this week\u2019s
