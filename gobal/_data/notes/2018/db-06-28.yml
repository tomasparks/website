      content: "Episode #202 \u2013 Insert Disk 2 Special - Instant Remedy (in collaboration
        with 010101 Music)\r\n\r\nSwedish remixing legend Martin Noriander Instant
        Remedy is finally back with a brand-new album - \"Insert Disk 2\" celebrates
        the 30th anniversary of the Amiga brand with a fine selection of arranged
        game and demoscene tracks from the 16-bit era. Episode #202 features tracks
        from this new album, its predecessor, as well as original game music composed
        by Instant Remedy.\r\n\r\nSays Martin: \"When the internet was still young,
        me and a few classmates discovered the HVSC and SIDPLay. All of a sudden it
        was possible to listen to all those great tunes - without the hassle of setting
        up a real C64 to load the games! However, I wanted to add something to the
        SID music to make it sound fuller and suitable for listening on a stereo system.
        So I started adding some drums, bass and other stuff, just for fun. At first,
        I played these tracks for friends only. Remixing game music was not as common
        back then as it is today. They really liked what I had done, so I decided
        to submit MP3s to some sites... and so my remixes started to spread.\"\r\n\r\nMixed
        by Jegougou, logo by KF, thank you to Instant Remedy, Jan Zottmann and Bobic"
