      name: Donald Trump, Howard Stern... And Copyright
      author: Techdirt
      content: This episode was supposed to come two weeks ago when the news was a
        little fresher, so by now you almost certainly know all about the copyright
        claims on Donald Trump's appearances on the Howard Stern show. Though delayed
        by an outage at our cloud recording provider, the episode is still an interesting
        listen, with frequent Techdirt contributor Cathy Gellis joining the podcast
        to discuss the deeper question of whether copyright truly even exists on the
        interviews in the first place. Sorry for the delay, and we hope you enjoy
        it!

      name: WTF With Tim O'Reilly
      author: Techdirt
      content: "The rapid forward march of technology has long bred two leading camps
        of onlookers: the techno-optimists and the techno-pessimists. Honest people
        on both sides, however, must admit that technological innovation has had both
        positive and negative effects. Internet legend Tim O'Reilly is one of the
        people who think a lot about these issues, and his new book WTF? What's the
        Future and Why It's Up to Us \u2014 which discusses in detail the world that
        we are building with technology \u2014 was released today, and we're pleased
        to have him join us on this week's episode to talk about the book and the
        future of innovation."

      name: Who Still Needs A Personal Computer?
      author: Techdirt
      content: 'As smartphones and other mobile devices have gotten smarter and smarter,
        they''ve taken over more and more of most people''s general computing needs,
        and the importance of the classic personal computer has waned. And so for
        some time the question has been: will the PC ever go away entirely? That''s
        our topic this week as we try to figure out who really needs a PC these days,
        and when and if that will change.'

      author: Techdirt
      content: "I don't think I need to say much to introduce this week's topic \u2014
        we're all well aware of the conversation about Facebook's role in the presidential
        election, including questions of filter bubbles, fake news, foreign influence,
        and so on and so on. As is always the case in situations like this, a lot
        of people seem to be looking for easy answers, and easy places to point fingers
        of blame, so in this week's episode we're discussing why it's just not that
        simple."
