      name: The Crypto Wars May Never End
      author: Techdirt
      content: "The current instalment of the crypto wars hit full stride with the
        clash between Apple and the FBI, but in truth the tension over encryption
        has been around for a long time \u2014 and it doesn't look like it's going
        away anytime soon. As our readers know, Tim Cushing has been following these
        developments closely, and this week he joins the podcast for a discussion
        about encryption, law enforcement and \"going dark\"."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "In the post-Snowden era, we don't have to tell you how important it
        is to stay engaged with (and vigilant about) the surveillance state in America.
        Jennifer Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center
        for Internet and Society, and author of the new book American Spies \u2014
        and this week she joins us for an in-depth discussion about the surveillance
        state today. Of course, shortly after we recorded this podcast, the NSA made
        major changes to one of its surveillance programs, so Jennifer returned to
        record an addendum examining this latest news, so make sure you listen to
        the end!"
