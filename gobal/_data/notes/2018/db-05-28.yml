      content: Always-on, voice-operated assistants are on the rise, and most of the

        this week he's brought along Alexa, Google Now and Siri as guests for a discussion
        about the future of this technology.

      author: Techdirt
      content: "From its humble origins as an online bookseller that many people worried
        might not survive, Amazon has grown into a critical piece of the web's backbone
        via its Amazon Web Services platform. Last week's S3 outage made this painfully
        clear, and understandably raised lots of concerns \u2014 especially after
        it was revealed that the whole thing was caused by a typo. So this week we're
        discussing whether something needs to be done, and what that might be."
