        Video Games'

      content: "Do you remember all of those video games that were made for girls
        back in the 90s? Well they're not being archived the same way that stereotypical
        boy games are being preserved. They don't have value in the gaming community
        and many of these games are being forgotten even though they were just as
        creative and innovative for the industry. Our guest Rachel Weil is trying
        to change that by preserving these 'girl' games by going around the world
        and collecting these games and talking to the people who made them. She is
        a software developer for Microsoft and the founder of the Femicom Museum,
        \ a hybrid physical/digital museum and archive dedicated to the preservation
        and reimagination of femininity, girlhood, and the aesthetics of cute within
        twentieth-century video games, computing, and electronic toys. Rachel did
        not appear on the Adam Ruins Everything TV show but her work reminded us of
        the themes we explored in our Adam Ruins Summer Fun episode. And since we're
        in the off-season of the TV show, we'll be inviting more guests onto the podcast
        whose work relates to themes we explored on the TV show or who are doing fascinating
        work or research that's worth discussing anyway. On the podcast Adam and Rachel
        had a lively discussion about gender expectations, the negative effects of
        marketing towards girls and boys, their favorite classic games and even their
        favorite savory breakfasts.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter @AdamConover and you
        can find past episodes and bonus content from the TruTV show at AdamRuinsEverything.com.\r\n\r\nProduced

        Improve Cancer Research'
      author: Adam Ruins Everything
      content: "When we think of conducting science experiments on subjects, we immediately
        think of mice models. But today's guest, Dr. Azra Raza, who appeared on Adam
        Ruins Science, says there's a more effective way. On the TV show Dr. Raza
        discussed how the mouse model scientists use for their research is actually
        ineffective; even though a medicine might work well on a rodent, the results
        don't translate as well as we thought to humans - especially when it comes
        to cancer research which is what Dr. Raza studies. Even though humans and
        mice share over 90 percent of their DNA with one another, our bodies still
        differ in numerous ways; we metabolize food and medicine differently and humans
        are significantly bigger than mice in size. This wastes money from the limited
        amount of funding that already exists and encourages clinical trials that
        ultimately go nowhere. On the podcast, Dr. Raza proposes a different research
        method that she has used herself, to much success.\r\n\r\nDr. Raza is a Professor
        of Medicine and Director of the MDS Center at Columbia University in New York.
        Previously she conducted her research at Rush University, Chicago, Illinois
        in 1992, where she was the Charles Arthur Weaver Professor in Oncology and
        Director, Division of Myeloid Diseases.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter @AdamConover
