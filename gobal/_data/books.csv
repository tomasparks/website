"Various","Various","This publication offers a broad view on media piracy as well as a variety of comparative perspectives on recent issues and historical facts regarding piracy. It contains a compilation of texts on grass-roots situations whose stories describe strategies developed to share, distribute and experience cultural content outside of the confines of local economies, politics or laws. These stories recount the experiences of individuals from India, Cuba, Brazil, Mexico, Mali and China. The book is structured in four parts and begins with a collection of stories on piracy dating back to the invention of the printing press and expanding to broader issues (historical & modern anti-piracy technologies, geographically-specific issues, as well as the rules of the Warez scene, its charters, structure and visual culture…).

"Sinnreich, Aram","Aram Sinnreich","In the decade and a half since Napster first emerged, forever changing the face of digital culture, the claim that ""internet pirates killed the music industry"" has become so ubiquitous that it is treated as common knowledge. Piracy is a scourge on legitimate businesses and hard-working artists, we are told, a ""cybercrime"" similar to identity fraud or even terrorism. 
In The Piracy Crusade, Aram Sinnreich critiques the notion of ""piracy"" as a myth perpetuated by today's cultural cartels -- the handful of companies that dominate the film, software, and especially music industries. As digital networks have permeated our social environment, they have offered vast numbers of people the opportunity to experiment with innovative cultural and entrepreneurial ideas predicated on the belief that information should be shared widely. This has left the media cartels, whose power has historically resided in their ability to restrict the flow of cultural information, with difficult choices: adapt to this new environment, fight the changes tooth and nail, or accept obsolescence. Their decision to fight has resulted in ever stronger copyright laws and the aggressive pursuit of accused infringers. 
Yet the most dangerous legacy of this ""piracy crusade"" is not the damage inflicted on promising start-ups or on well-intentioned civilians caught in the crosshairs of file-sharing litigation. Far more troubling, Sinnreich argues, are the broader implications of copyright laws and global treaties that sacrifice free speech and privacy in the name of combating the phantom of piracy -- policies that threaten to undermine the foundations of democratic society.

"Swartz, Aaron & Lessig, Lawrence","Aaron Swartz & Lawrence Lessig","In his too-short life, Aaron Swartz reshaped the Internet, questioned our assumptions about intellectual property, and touched all of us in ways that we may not even realize. His tragic suicide in 2013 at the age of twenty-six after being aggressively prosecuted for copyright infringement shocked the nation and the world. 
Here for the first time in print is revealed the quintessential Aaron Swartz: besides being a technical genius and a passionate activist, he was also an insightful, compelling, and cutting essayist. With a technical understanding of the Internet and of intellectual property law surpassing that of many seasoned professionals, he wrote thoughtfully and humorously about intellectual property, copyright, and the architecture of the Internet. He wrote as well about unexpected topics such as pop culture, politics both electoral and idealistic, dieting, and lifehacking. Including three in-depth and previously unpublished essays about education, governance, and cities, *The Boy Who Could Change the World* contains the life’s work of one of the most original minds of our time.

### Review
**Praise for *The Boy Who Could Change the World* :**  
""The book’s curated tour of Swartz’s legacy reads less like a posthumous time capsule and more like the record of one mind thinking, beautifully, against itself.""  
— *The Nation*
“[A] remarkably substantial collection of writings given the terrible brevity of Swartz’s intellectualy daring life, from his geeky ardor for code to his collaborative, web-driven dreams of saving the world.”  
— *Booklist* (starred review) 
[“A]n elegiac project about a young man who had a good heart, unlimited potential, and wanted to help people.”  
— *The New Republic*
""For me, reading this book was a revelatory experience.""  
—Chelsea Manning 
“Reading some of these essays is like peeking at the secret history of the modern Internet and having the curtain pulled back in the political arena.”  
— *Publishers Weekly*
“An important record of forward-looking thought cut short.”  
— *Kirkus*
**Praise for Aaron Swartz:**  
""What a bittersweet exhilaration you feel re-reading Swartz's impossibly brilliant, capacious writings all in one place. This volume makes clear what those of us who knew Aaron already grasped: when we lost Aaron, we lost one of the most exciting minds of our time.""  
—Chris Hayes 
""He was brilliant and funny. A kid genius…Aaron was not just, or even primarily, a computer geek. His defining feature was a constant struggle for what he believed was right.""  
—Lawrence Lessig 
""Aaron had an unbeatable combination of political insight, technical skill, and intelligence about people and issues. I think he could have revolutionized American (and worldwide) politics. His legacy may still yet do so.""  
—Cory Doctorow 
""I always found it genuinely inspiring to watch Swartz exude [his] courage and commitment at such a young age.""  
—Glenn Greenwald 
""We've lost a fighter. We've lost somebody who put huge energy into righting wrongs.""  
—Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Inventor of the World Wide Web

Smart, fast, and wise to the ways of the networked world, he has no trouble outwitting his high school's intrusive but clumsy surveillance systems.
But his whole world changes when he and his friends find themselves caught in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack on San Francisco. In the wrong place at the wrong time, Marcus and his crew are apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security and whisked away to a secret prison where they're mercilessly interrogated for days.
When the DHS finally releases them, Marcus discovers that his city has become a police state where every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist. He knows that no one will believe his story, which leaves him only one option: to take down the DHS himself.

### From School Library Journal
Starred Review. Grade 10 Up—When he ditches school one Friday morning, 17-year-old Marcus is hoping to get a head start on the Harajuku Fun Madness clue. But after a terrorist attack in San Francisco, he and his friends are swept up in the extralegal world of the Department of Homeland Security. After questioning that includes physical torture and psychological stress, Marcus is released, a marked man in a much darker San Francisco: a city of constant surveillance and civil-liberty forfeiture. Encouraging hackers from around the city, Marcus fights against the system while falling for one hacker in particular. Doctorow rapidly confronts issues, from civil liberties to cryptology to social justice. While his political bias is obvious, he does try to depict opposing viewpoints fairly. Those who have embraced the legislative developments since 9/11 may be horrified by his harsh take on Homeland Security, Guantánamo Bay, and the PATRIOT Act. Politics aside, Marcus is a wonderfully developed character: hyperaware of his surroundings, trying to redress past wrongs, and rebelling against authority. Teen espionage fans will appreciate the numerous gadgets made from everyday materials. One afterword by a noted cryptologist and another from an infamous hacker further reflect Doctorow's principles, and a bibliography has resources for teens interested in intellectual freedom, information access, and technology enhancements. Curious readers will also be able to visit BoingBoing, an eclectic group blog that Doctorow coedits. Raising pertinent questions and fostering discussion, this techno-thriller is an outstanding first purchase.— *Chris Shoemaker, New York Public Library*

### From Booklist
*Starred Review* Seventeen-year-old techno-geek “w1n5t0n” (aka Marcus) bypasses the school’s gait-recognition system by placing pebbles in his shoes, chats secretly with friends on his IMParanoid messaging program, and routinely evades school security with his laptop, cell, WifFnder, and ingenuity. While skipping school, Markus is caught near the site of a terrorist attack on San Francisco and held by the Department of Homeland Security for six days of intensive interrogation. After his release, he vows to use his skills to fight back against an increasingly frightening system of surveillance. Set in the near future, Doctorow’s novel blurs the lines between current and potential technologies, and readers will delight in the details of how Markus attempts to stage a techno-revolution. Obvious parallels to Orwellian warnings and post-9/11 policies, such as the Patriot Act, will provide opportunity for classroom discussion and raise questions about our enthusiasm for technology, who monitors our school library collections, and how we contribute to our own lack of privacy. An extensive Web and print bibliography will build knowledge and make adults nervous. Buy multiple copies; this book will be h4wt (that’s “hot,” for the nonhackers). Grades 8-12. --Cindy Dobrez

"Lessig, Lawrence","Lawrence Lessig","The Internet revolution has come. Some say it has gone. In **The Future of Ideas** , Lawrence Lessig explains how the revolution has produced a counterrevolution of potentially devastating power and effect. Creativity once flourished because the Net protected a commons on which widest range of innovators could experiment. But now, manipulating the law for their own purposes, corporations have established themselves as virtual gatekeepers of the Net while Congress, in the pockets of media magnates, has rewritten copyright and patent laws to stifle creativity and progress. 
Lessig weaves the history of technology and its relevant laws to make a lucid and accessible case to protect the sanctity of intellectual freedom. He shows how the door to a future of ideas is being shut just as technology is creating extraordinary possibilities that have implications for all of us. Vital, eloquent, judicious and forthright, **The Future of Ideas** ** is a call to arms that we can ill afford to ignore.
**
### Amazon.com Review
If *The Future of Ideas* is bleak, we have nobody to blame but ourselves. Author Lawrence Lessig, a Stanford law professor and keen observer of emerging technologies, makes a strong case that large corporations are staging an innovation-stifling power grab while we watch idly. The changes in copyright and other forms of intellectual property protection demanded by the media and software industries have the potential to choke off publicly held material, which Lessig sees as a kind of intellectual commons. He eloquently and persuasively decries this lopsided control of ideas and suggests practical solutions that consider the rights of both creators and consumers, while acknowledging the serious impact of new technologies on old ways of doing business. His proposals would let existing companies make money without using the tremendous advantages of incumbency to eliminate new killer apps before they can threaten the status quo. Readers who want a fair intellectual marketplace would do well to absorb the lessons in *The Future of Ideas*. *\--Rob Lightner*
### From Library Journal
Is the Internet evolving into a controlled environment? Should it be completely free from intellectual property rights? Lessig (Stanford Law Sch.; Code: And Other Laws of Cyberspace) argues that as the Internet faces the challenges of intellectual property laws, it should not become so controlled that it discourages innovation and creativity in the digital world. He explains the historical context of the Internet and its relationship to the ""commons"" (items that are made available for free) and argues that, for the Internet to evolve and be an open environment, there must be a balance between intellectual property and the public domain. His book is filled with current case and social histories, as well as extensive source notes. His examples are thorough but can be excessively detailed. Though it is written for the lay reader, it will be better understood by those with some technological background. Recommended for all types of libraries, especially those maintaining materials on intellectual property. Rob Martindale, Dallas P.L.

### Review
""[Lessig] is fast emerging as the nation's most original thinker in the new field of cyberspace."" 
""A book that's sometimes as brilliant as the best teacher you ever had, sometimes as pretentious as a deconstructionists' conference."" 
""In this remarkably clear and elegantly written book, [Lessig] takes apart many myths about cyberspace and analyzes its underlying architecture."" 
The ""alarming and impassioned"" book on how the Internet is redefining constitutional law, now reissued as the first popular book revised online by its readers. 
""A remarkable work on the philosophy of this new medium, his latest book asks all the big questions about the role of government, commerce and the invisible hand of technology in shaping life as it is increasingly lived online."" 
""Lawrence Lessig is a James Madison of our time, crafting the lineaments of a well-tempered cyberspace. This book is a primer of 'running code' for digital civilization. Like Madison, Lessig is a model of balance, judgement, ingenuity and persuasive argument."" -- Stewart Brand

"Lessig, Lawrence","Lawrence Lessig","The reigning authority on intellectual property in the Internet age, Lawrence Lessig spotlights the newest and possibly the most harmful culture war?a war waged against those who create and consume art. America?s copyright laws have ceased to perform their original, beneficial role: protecting artists? creations while allowing them to build on previous creative works. In fact, our system now criminalizes those very actions. Remix is an urgent, eloquent plea to end a war that harms every intrepid, creative user of new technologies. It also offers an inspiring vision of the postwar world where enormous opportunities await those who view art as a resource to be shared openly rather than a commodity to be hoarded.

### From Publishers Weekly
Should anyone besides libertarian hackers or record companies care about copyright in the online world? In this incisive treatise, Stanford law prof and *Wired* columnist Lessig ( *Free Culture* ) argues that we should. He frames the problem as a war between an old read-only culture, in which media megaliths sell copyrighted music and movies to passive consumers, and a dawning digital read-write culture, in which audiovisual products are freely downloaded and manipulated in an explosion of democratized creativity. Both cultures can thrive in a hybrid economy, he contends, pioneered by Web entities like YouTube. Lessig's critique of draconian copyright laws—highlighted by horror stories of entertainment conglomerates threatening tweens for putting up Harry Potter fan sites—is trenchant. (Why, he asks, should sampling music and movies be illegal when quoting texts is fine?) Lessig worries that too stringent copyright laws could stifle such remix masterpieces as a powerful doctored video showing George Bush and Tony Blair lip-synching the song Endless Love, or making scofflaws of America's youth by criminalizing their irrepressible downloading. We leave this (copyrighted) book feeling the stakes are pretty low, except for media corporations. *(Oct. 20)*

### From The New Yorker
As Lessig, a law professor at Stanford, sees it, if intellectual-property law is left as it is an entire generation will be criminalized. He argues that the ways in which young people break copyright laws help them to become the sort of people we want them to be'creative and collaborative. Kids today are simply not going to give up downloading music and using copyrighted material in YouTube videos: they belong to a culture for which 'remix' is 'the essential art.' Lessig's proposals for revising copyright are compelling, because they rethink intellectual-property rights without abandoning them. He argues that hybrids that combine the 'commercial and sharing' economies can create value for both sides (as Harry Potter fan sites and Lostpedia have done); indeed, one problem is media companies' appropriating the work of fans without returning the favor. 'When both benefit,' Lessig writes, 'how do we say who is riding for free?'

"Lessig, Lawrence","Lawrence Lessig","Lawrence Lessig, “the most important thinker on intellectual property in the Internet era” ( **The New Yorker** ), masterfully argues that never before in human history has the power to control creative progress been so concentrated in the hands of the powerful few, the so-called Big Media. Never before have the cultural powers- that-be been able to exert such control over what we can and can’t do with the culture around us. Our society defends free markets and free speech; why then does it permit such top-down control? To lose our long tradition of free culture, Lawrence Lessig shows us, is to lose our freedom to create, our freedom to build, and, ultimately, our freedom to imagine.

### From Publishers Weekly
From Stanford law professor Lessig (Code; The Future of Ideas) comes this expertly argued, alarming and surprisingly entertaining look at the current copyright wars. Copyright law in the digital age has become a hot topic, thanks to millions of music downloaders and the controversial, high-profile legal efforts of the music industry to stop them. Here Lessig argues that copyright as designed by the Framers has become dangerously unbalanced, favoring the interests of corporate giants over the interests of citizens and would-be innovators. In clear, well-paced prose, Lessig illustrates how corporations attempt to stifle innovations, from FM radio and the instant camera to peer-to-peer technology. He debunks the myth that draconian new copyright enforcement is needed to combat the entertainment industry's expanded definition of piracy, and chillingly assesses the direct and collateral damage of the copyright war. Information technology student Jesse Jordan, for example, was forced to hand over his life savings to settle a lawsuit brought by the music industry—for merely fixing a glitch in an Internet search engine. Lessig also offers a very personal look into his failed Supreme Court bid to overturn the Copyright Term Extension Act, a law that added 20 years to copyright protections largely to protect Mickey Mouse from the public domain. In addition to offering a brilliant argument, Lessig also suggests a few solutions, including the Creative Commons licensing venture (an online licensing venture that streamlines the rights process for creators), as well as legislative solutions. This is an important book. ""Free Cultures are cultures that leave a great deal open for others to build upon,"" he writes. ""Ours was a free culture. It is becoming less so.""

### From Booklist
Lessig looks at the disturbing legal and commercial trends that threaten to curb the incredible creative potential of the Internet. All innovations are derived from a certain amount of ""piracy"" of preceding innovations, Lessig argues, and he presents a catalog of technological breakthroughs in film, music, and television as illustrations. Drawing on distinctions between piracy that benefits a single user and harms the owner and piracy that is useful in advancing new content or new ways of doing business, Lessig strongly argues for a balance between the interests of the owner and broader society so that we can continue a ""free culture"" that encourages innovation rather than a ""permission culture"" that does not. He reviews an array of legal actions, including the restrictions on peer-to-peer sharing made famous by Napster, and the threat they represent to the kind of openness the law has traditionally allowed and from which the marketplace has benefited. This is a highly accessible and enlightening look at the intersection of commerce, the law, and cyberspace. *Vanessa Bush*

Designers who are used to working with HTML files can work with Smarty templates, which are HTML files with simple tags while programmers work with the underlying PHP code. The Smarty engine brings the code and templates together. The result of all this is that designers can concentrate on designing, programmers can concentrate on programming, and they don't need to get in each others way so much. Even if you are developing a site on your own, Smarty is a powerful way to make your code clearer to you and others, as well as easier to debug and modify later. This book is written for PHP developers who want to use Smarty templates in their development, and for designers who are working with PHP developers who are using Smarty.

"Kildall, Gary","Gary Kildall","“Our father, Gary Kildall, was one of the founders of the personal computer industry, but you probably don’t know his name. Those who have heard of him may recall the myth that he ‘missed’ the opportunity to become Bill Gates by going flying instead of meeting with IBM. Unfortunately, this tall tale paints Gary as a ‘could-have-been,’ ignores his deep contributions, and overshadows his role as an inventor of key technologies that define how computer platforms run today.
Gary viewed computers as learning tools rather than profit engines. His career choices reflect a different definition of success, where innovation means sharing ideas, letting passion drive your work and making source code available for others to build upon. His work ethic during the 1970s resembles that of the open-source community today.
With this perspective, we offer a portion of our father’s unpublished memoirs so that you can read about his experiences and reflections on the early days of the computer industry, directly in his own voice.
In this excerpt Gary writes about his vision for bringing the new microprocessors into homes and businesses. In 1974, he invented CP/M, the first operating system that could run on these new desktop platforms. Soon after, he created the BIOS, which enabled CP/M to easily interface with different computer hardware.
CP/M became the *de facto* standard personal computer operating system in these early days. For the next 20 years, Gary continued inventing and breaking ground on new technologies, such as the first commercially available CD-ROM: an encyclopedia, which provided a comprehensive source of desktop knowledge.
[![Unnamed image](http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GaryDorortyProm-225x300.jpg)](http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GaryDorortyProm.jpg)
Gary and Dorothy at their high school prom in 1961
With our mother, Dorothy McEwen, Gary founded Digital Research Inc. (DRI) as a software company in 1974, in the beachside town of Pacific Grove, just a one-hour drive south of Silicon Valley. This software startup was the vehicle for his inventions. DRI provided the CP/M source code to Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and created an API that enabled companies to develop new software applications. Our parents believed that the operating system business should be separate from the applications business, to create a more thriving industry without monopolistic practices.

Scott Kildall and classmates (with Gary in the background) in R2D2 costumes made by Gary in 1977
On the personal side, our father worked passionately to share his creations but also led a balanced life and was dedicated to our family. Our dad was just as likely to put in late night hours at work as to cut out early to take us waterskiing, have a backyard party, or make R2-D2 costumes for the entire second-grade class. As kids we didn’t see him as a software genius, but as a dedicated father who opened up our own creative channels. He showed us how to draw cartoon characters, and how to make a faster derby race car. He made backyard movies with us, played the guitar, and sang to us each night as we fell asleep. We are grateful to be his family and to share a part of his life with you.
While this excerpt was part of an early draft of Gary’s memoir that he shared only with family and friends, we feel that we are honoring his love of sharing ideas by making it available. In this excerpt, you will read how Gary and Dorothy started from modest means as a young married couple, paved a new path for start-up culture, and embraced their idea of success to become leaders in the industry. Our father embodied a definition of success that we can all learn from: one that puts inventions, ideas, and a love of life before profits as the paramount goal.

Dorothy and Gary, ca 1978
We have chosen to release only the first portion of his memoir. Unfortunately Gary’s passion for life also manifested in a struggle with alcoholism, and we feel that the unpublished preface and later chapters do not reflect his true self. If you want to read more about events in his later life and the further development of CP/M, [*They Made America* by Harold Evans, Gail Buckland, and David Lefer](https://www.amazon.com/They-Made-America-Centuries-Innovators-ebook/dp/B000SEVPLQ) has an excellent chapter on this topic.
We hope you enjoy this glimpse into the life of a man who was inventive, compassionate and loved life.”  
– Scott Kildall and Kristin Kildall

### From Publishers Weekly
Supporters will hail this New Age self-help book on the law of attraction as a groundbreaking and life-changing work, finding validation in its thesis that one's positive thoughts are powerful magnets that attract wealth, health, happiness... and did we mention wealth? Detractors will be appalled by this as well as when the book argues that fleeting negative thoughts are powerful enough to create terminal illness, poverty and even widespread disasters. The audio version of this controversial book, read by Byrne and contributing authors such as John Gray and Neale Donald Walsch, is uneven at best. The cheesy, obvious sound effects will not do much to add intellectual respectability to a work that has been widely denounced as pseudoscience. Mostly, this audio is hampered by its confusing and disjointed organization—techniques that worked reasonably well in the print version and the movie, such as cutting every few seconds from one enthusiastic expert to another, make for a choppy and somewhat bewildering listening experience. The gentle cadences of Rhonda Byrne's breathy, Aussie-infused voice are certainly the best part of the audio, but her material is scarce and provides mostly connective tissue between the testimonials.

### From the Publisher
The Secret is truly the most outstanding book to date that we have published. I am so pleased that Rhonda Byrne was able to bring together this life-changing information so masterfully. She first did it for the movie of the same name that she produced, which has been a phenomenon in its own right. She then added, in only ones month's time, incredible additional content to the transcript of the film that brings even more clarity to the reader. This is absolutely a book that people from all walks of life can read and then ""get"" the concept of The Secret. It allows them to then take it and apply it to their lives. Children, teenagers and adults of all ages are reporting miraculous stories of positive changes as a result. Rhonda Byrne is dedicated to maintaining the integrity of The Secret and to making sure that now, finally, the whole world knows about The Secret. You will want to share this with your friends and family and they will be grateful for it. This book gives hope for what many have been waiting for-- a shift in the way the world thinks. Its a very exciting time that we are living in, and I as well as everyone at Beyond Words and Atria Books are grateful to be a part of it.

"Levy, Steven","Steven Levy","This 25th anniversary edition of Steven Levy's classic book traces the exploits of the computer revolution's original hackers -- those brilliant and eccentric nerds from the late 1950s through the early '80s who took risks, bent the rules, and pushed the world in a radical new direction. With updated material from noteworthy hackers such as Bill Gates, Mark Zukerberg, Richard Stallman, and Steve Wozniak, *Hackers* is a fascinating story that begins in early computer research labs and leads to the first home computers. 
Levy profiles the imaginative brainiacs who found clever and unorthodox solutions to computer engineering problems. They had a shared sense of values, known as ""the hacker ethic,"" that still thrives today. *Hackers* captures a seminal period in recent history when underground activities blazed a trail for today's digital world, from MIT students finagling access to clunky computer-card machines to the DIY culture that spawned the Altair and the Apple II.
 **Amazon.com Exclusive: The Rant Heard Round the World**   
**By Steven Levy**
Author Steven LevyWhen I began researching *Hacker* s--so many years ago that it’s scary--I thought I’d largely be chronicling the foibles of a sociologically weird cohort who escaped normal human interaction by retreating to the sterile confines of computers labs. Instead, I discovered a fascinating, funny cohort who wound up transforming human interaction, spreading a culture that affects our views about everything from politics to entertainment to business. The stories of those amazing people and what they did is the backbone of *Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution*. 
But when I revisited the book recently to prepare the 25th Anniversary Edition of my first book, it was clear that I had luckily stumbled on the origin of a computer (and Internet) related controversy that still permeates the digital discussion. Throughout the book I write about something I called The Hacker Ethic, my interpretation of several principles implicitly shared by true hackers, no matter whether they were among the early pioneers from MIT’s Tech Model Railroad Club (the Mesopotamia of hacker culture), the hardware hackers of Silicon Valley’s Homebrew Computer Club (who invented the PC industry), or the slick kid programmers of commercial game software. One of those principles was “Information Should Be Free.” This wasn’t a justification of stealing, but an expression of the yearning to know more so one could hack more. The programs that early MIT hackers wrote for big computers were stored on paper tapes. The hackers would keep the tapes in a drawer by the computer so anyone could run the program, change it, and then cut a new tape for the next person to improve. The idea of ownership was alien. 
This idea came under stress with the advent of personal computers. The Homebrew Club was made of fanatic engineers, along with a few social activists who were thrilled at the democratic possibilities of PCs. The first home computer they could get their hands on was 1975’s Altair, which came in a kit that required a fairly hairy assembly process. (Its inventor was Ed Roberts, an underappreciated pioneer who died earlier this year.) No software came with it. So it was a big deal when 19-year-old Harvard undergrad Bill Gates and his partner Paul Allen wrote a BASIC computer language for it. The Homebrew people were delighted with Altair BASIC, but unhappy that Gates and Allen charged real money for it. Some Homebrew people felt that their need for it outweighed their ability to pay. And after one of them got hold of a “borrowed” tape with the program, he showed up at a meeting with a box of copies (because it is so easy to make perfect copies in the digital age), and proceeded to distribute them to anyone who wanted one, gratis. 
This didn’t sit well with Bill Gates, who wrote what was to become a famous “Letter to Hobbyists,” basically accusing them of stealing his property. It was the computer-age equivalent to Luther posting the Ninety-Five Theses on the Castle Church. Gate’s complaints would reverberate well into the Internet age, and variations on the controversy persist. Years later, when another undergrad named Shawn Fanning wrote a program called Napster that kicked off massive piracy of song files over the Internet, we saw a bloodier replay of the flap. Today, issues of cost, copying and control still rage--note Viacom’s continuing lawsuit against YouTube and Google. And in my own business—journalism--availability of free news is threatening more traditional, expensive new-gathering. Related issues that also spring from controversies in *Hackers* are debates over the “walled gardens” of Facebook and Apple’s iPad. 
I ended the original *Hackers* with a portrait of Richard Stallman, an MIT hacker dedicated to the principle of free software. I recently revisited him while gathering new material for the 25th Anniversary Edition of *Hackers* , he was more hard core than ever. He even eschewed the Open Source movement for being insufficiently noncommercial. 
When I spoke to Gates for the update, I asked him about his 1976 letter and the subsequent intellectual property wars. “Don’t call it war,” he said. “Thank God we have an incentive system. Striking the right balance of how this should work, you know, there's going to be tons of exploration.” Then he applied the controversy to my own situation as a journalism. “Things are in a crazy way for music and movies and books,” he said. “Maybe magazine writers will still get paid 20 years from now. Who knows? Maybe you'll have to cut hair during the day and just write articles at night.” 
So Amazon.com readers, it’s up to you. Those who have not read *Hackers,* , have fun and be amazed at the tales of those who changed the world and had a hell of time doing it. Those who have previously read and loved *Hackers* , replace your beat-up copies, or the ones you loaned out and never got back, with this beautiful 25th Anniversary Edition from O’Reilly with new material about my subsequent visits with Gates, Stallman, and younger hacker figures like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. If you don’t I may have to buy a scissors--and the next bad haircut could be yours! 
Read Bill Gates' letter to hobbyists

### Amazon.com Review
Steven Levy's classic book explains why the misuse of the word ""hackers"" to describe computer criminals does a terrible disservice to many important shapers of the digital revolution. Levy follows members of an MIT model railroad club--a group of brilliant budding electrical engineers and computer innovators--from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s. These eccentric characters used the term ""hack"" to describe a clever way of improving the electronic system that ran their massive railroad. And as they started designing clever ways to improve computer systems, ""hack"" moved over with them. These maverick characters were often fanatics who did not always restrict themselves to the letter of the law and who devoted themselves to what became known as ""The Hacker Ethic."" The book traces the history of hackers, from finagling access to clunky computer-card-punching machines to uncovering the inner secrets of what would become the Internet. This story of brilliant, eccentric, flawed, and often funny people devoted to their dream of a better world will appeal to a wide audience.

"Wells, H. G.","H. G. Wells","H. G. Wells' best-selling classic THE WAR OF THE WORLDS
**
### Amazon.com Review
This is the granddaddy of all alien invasion stories, first published by H.G. Wells in 1898. The novel begins ominously, as the lone voice of a narrator tells readers that ""No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's..."" 
Things then progress from a series of seemingly mundane reports about odd atmospheric disturbances taking place on Mars to the arrival of Martians just outside of London. At first the Martians seem laughable, hardly able to move in Earth's comparatively heavy gravity even enough to raise themselves out of the pit created when their spaceship landed. But soon the Martians reveal their true nature as death machines 100-feet tall rise up from the pit and begin laying waste to the surrounding land. Wells quickly moves the story from the countryside to the evacuation of London itself and the loss of all hope as England's military suffers defeat after defeat. With horror his narrator describes how the Martians suck the blood from living humans for sustenance, and how it's clear that man is not being conquered so much a corralled. *\--Craig E. Engler*
### From Library Journal
This edition of Wells's much disguised attack on British imperialism includes a scholarly introduction, a biographical preface and chronology of the author's life, maps of the Martian landing sites, and explanatory notes. A lot of extras for the price.

"McNutt, Dinah & Beyer, Betsy","Dinah McNutt & Betsy Beyer","Release engineering is a relatively new and fast-growing discipline for building and delivering software. Release engineers at Google, for instance, use knowledge of development, configuration management, test integration, system administration, and customer support to compile, assemble, and deliver source code into software components or finished products.  
With this excerpt from O’Reilly’s Site Reliability Engineering, you’ll learn how Google’s approach can inform your own company’s release engineering process—regardless of company size or the tools you use. Google Release Team member Dinah McNutt explains the rationale behind the company’s release engineering philosophy of self-sufficient teams, frequent (often-hourly) releases, and a self-contained build process that depends on known versions of build tools and dependencies.  
You’ll discover a proven process for manufacturing software that is repeatable, gives predictable results, scales well, and can contribute to the growth of your company.

Blender is an open source modeling and animation program popular in the 3D printing community. 3D printing demands more of a modeler than animation or virtual reality. The model maker must engineer their model to work in the real world. They must keep in mind the particular needs of the materials and printers that they are planning to use to print their model. 
This practical guide gives Blender users all the information they need to design high-quality 3D printed objects. With a solid exploration of the 3D modeling process, design considerations for 3D printing, plus step-by-step exercises, you will soon be comfortable making 3D objects for real-world enjoyment. 
Starting with an overview of 3D printing, this guide moves onto to precision measurement, fixing problems in a 3D model, and how to make it light and strong enough for real-world use. 
You will learn how to scale, build, and detail a model for a 3D printer. You will learn to color and decorate it, as well as making parts precisely in the size you want them, so that multi-part objects fit together smoothly. You will also learn tips on saving money when you have printed your model. 
With the help of this guide, you will be able to complete your project and learn how to export the file so it is ready for a variety of 3D printers. 
**What you will learn from this book**
  * Understand how a 3D printer makes a 3D object

"Green, Dale","Dale Green","**Get to know techniques and approaches to procedurally generate game content in C++ using Simple and Fast Multimedia Library**
## About This Book
  * This book contains a bespoke Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) game engine with complete online documentation
  * Through this book, you'll create games that are non-predictable and dynamic and have a high replayability factor
  * Get a breakdown of the key techniques and approaches applied to a real game.


## Who This Book Is For
If you are a game developer who is familiar with C++ and is looking to create bigger and more dynamic games, then this book is for you. The book assumes some prior experience with C++, but any intermediate concepts are clarified in detail. No prior experience with SFML is required.
## What You Will Learn
  * Discover the systems and ideology that lie at the heart of procedural systems
  * Use Random number generation (RNG) with C++ data types to create random but controlled results
  * Build levels procedurally with randomly located items and events
  * Create dynamic game objects at runtime
  * Construct games using a component-based approach
  * Assemble non-predictable game events and scenarios
  * Operate procedural generation to create dynamic content fast and easily
  * Generate game environments for endless replayability


## In Detail
Procedural generation is a growing trend in game development. It allows developers to create games that are bigger and more dynamic, giving the games a higher level of replayability. Procedural generation isn't just one technique, it's a collection of techniques and approaches that are used together to create dynamic systems and objects. C++ is the industry-standard programming language to write computer games. It's at the heart of most engines, and is incredibly powerful. SFML is an easy-to-use, cross-platform, and open-source multimedia library. Access to computer hardware is broken into succinct modules, making it a great choice if you want to develop cross-platform games with ease.
Using C++ and SFML technologies, this book will guide you through the techniques and approaches used to generate content procedurally within game development.
Throughout the course of this book, we'll look at examples of these technologies, starting with setting up a roguelike project using the C++ template. We'll then move on to using RNG with C++ data types and randomly scattering objects within a game map. We will create simple console examples to implement in a real game by creating unique and randomised game items, dynamic sprites, and effects, and procedurally generating game events. Then we will walk you through generating random game maps. At the end, we will have a retrospective look at the project.
By the end of the book, not only will you have a solid understanding of procedural generation, but you'll also have a working roguelike game that you will have extended using the examples provided.
## Style and approach
This is an easy-to-follow guide where each topic is explained clearly and thoroughly through the use of a bespoke example, then implemented in a real game project.

"Curtis, Keith Cary","Keith Cary Curtis","Computers are an advancement whose importance is comparable to the invention of the wheel or movable type. While computers and the Internet have already changed many aspects of our lives, we still live in the dark ages of computing because proprietary software is still the dominant model. One might say that the richest alchemist who ever lived is my former boss, Bill Gates. (Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are close behind.) Human knowledge increasingly exists in digital form, so building new and better models requires the software to be improved. People can only share ideas when they also share the software to display and modify them. It is the expanded use of free software that will allow a greater ability for people to work together and increase the pace of progress. This book will demonstrate that a system where anyone can edit, share, and review the body of work will lead not just to something that works, but eventually to the best that the world can achieve! With better cooperation among our scientists, robot-driven cars is just one of the many inventions that will arrive -- pervasive robotics, artificial intelligence, and much faster progress in biology, all of which rely heavily on software. - Publisher.

"Wellman, Dan","Dan Wellman","Ten practical projects that exercise your skill, build your confidence, and help you master jQuery 
**Overview**
  * See how many of jQuery's methods and properties are used in real situations. Covers jQuery 1.9. 
  * Learn to build jQuery from source files, write jQuery plugins, and use jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile.
  * Familiarise yourself with the latest related technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and frameworks like Knockout.js.


**In Detail**
jQuery is used by millions of people to write JavaScript more easily and more quickly. It has become the standard tool for web developers and designers to add dynamic, interactive elements to their sites, smoothing out browser inconsistencies and reducing costly development time.
jQuery Hotshot walks you step by step through 10 projects designed to familiarise you with the jQuery library and related technologies. Each project focuses on a particular subject or section of the API, but also looks at something related, like jQuery's official templates, or an HTML5 feature like localStorage. Build your knowledge of jQuery and related technologies.
Learn a large swathe of the API, up to and including jQuery 1.9, by completing the ten individual projects covered in the book.
Some of the projects that we'll work through over the course of this book include a drag-and-drop puzzle game, a browser extension, a multi-file drag-and-drop uploader, an infinite scroller, a sortable table, and a heat map.
Learn which jQuery methods and techniques to use in which situations with jQuery Hotshots.
**What you will learn from this book**
  * Learn how to use the latest version of jQuery (1.9) in real-world situations. 
  * Create a jQuery plugin structured for organisation and maintainability. 
  * Construct a custom version of jQuery using Node.js and Grunt.js, and learn how to run unit tests using qUnit. 
  * Build on top of online services like Google Maps to create interactive interfaces. 
  * Use templating frameworks to easily and efficiently create repetitive areas of the page populated with data. 
  * Get started with the related jQuery-powered frameworks jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile. 
  * Produce interactive interfaces that respond to user interactions using the Model-View-View Model framework Knockout.js. 
  * Use the latest web standards like HTML5 and CSS3 to create attractive and semantic web pages. 


**Approach**
This book takes a hands-on, tutorial-style approach that walks you step -by -step through 10 individual projects that each focus on producing a specific, real-world product or application. 
**Who this book is written for**
This book is aimed primarily at front-end developers, preferably already with a little jQuery experience, or those people that simply want to build on their existing skills with jQuery.

"Maher, Jimmy","Jimmy Maher","The bulk of the posts here form an historical chronicle of interactive entertainment. This project could take years, but that’s fine; I’m enjoying it immensely, and happy to take my time poking at digital artifacts that are in many cases virtually forgotten. As I work my way through history, I’m also trying as much as possible to share the tools and techniques I use, to help digital historians who come after me and to help to preserve as much of this history as possible. In the long-term future, all this material I’ve written and continue to write will become… something. Maybe a book, maybe something else. I believe this history is important, and it’s one of my priorities in life to make sure it’s preserved so it can outlive me and my web-hosting contract. 
When I first started to blog, I wasn’t at all sure that anyone would care to read what I wrote. (No matter what they say, I’m convinced that every writer wants to be read, just as every kid who ever picks up an electric guitar dreams of playing to a stadium full of screaming girls.) I haven’t quite found my metaphorical stadium of screaming girls, but I’m happy that a fair number of you are reading. Thanks for that! I’ll try to make sure the content here remains worthy of your time.

"Thompson, Mick","Mick Thompson","Today's mobile devices have GPS and standard APIs to give you access to coordinates—but what can you *do* with that data? With this concise book, application developers learn how to work with location data quickly and easily, using Node.js, CouchDB, and other open source tools and libraries. 
Node.js makes it simple to run event code on the Web, and the CouchDB document-oriented database lets you store location data and perform complex queries on it quickly. You'll learn how to get started with these tools, and then use them together to build an example project called MapChat, using HTML and JavaScript code samples. 
Learn how to serve dynamic content with Node.js, and use its asynchronous IO to handle several requests at once  
Become familiar with GeoJSON, Geohash, and the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) for working with spatial data  
Build geospatial indexes using the GeoCouch branch of CouchDB  
Combine these tools to build a project that lets users post real-time chat messages tagged with their current map location

"Mailland, Julien & Driscoll, Kevin","Julien Mailland & Kevin Driscoll","**The first scholarly book in English on Minitel, the pioneering French computer network, offers a history of a technical system and a cultural phenomenon.**
A decade before the Internet became a medium for the masses in the United States, tens of millions of users in France had access to a network for e-mail, e-commerce, chat, research, game playing, blogging, and even an early form of online porn. In 1983, the French government rolled out Minitel, a computer network that achieved widespread adoption in just a few years as the government distributed free terminals to every French telephone subscriber. With this volume, Julien Mailland and Kevin Driscoll offer the first scholarly book in English on Minitel, examining it as both a technical system and a cultural phenomenon. 
Mailland and Driscoll argue that Minitel was a technical marvel, a commercial success, and an ambitious social experiment. Other early networks may have introduced protocols and software standards that continue to be used today, but Minitel foretold the social effects of widespread telecomputing. They examine the unique balance of forces that enabled the growth of Minitel: public and private, open and closed, centralized and decentralized. Mailland and Driscoll describe Minitel's key technological components, novel online services, and thriving virtual communities. Despite the seemingly tight grip of the state, however, a lively Minitel culture emerged, characterized by spontaneity, imagination, and creativity. After three decades of continuous service, Minitel was shut down in 2012, but the history of Minitel should continue to inform our thinking about Internet policy, today and into the future.

"Ryan, Johnny","Johnny Ryan","A great adjustment in human affairs is underway. Political, commercial and cultural life is changing from the centralized, hierarchical and standardized structures of the industrial age to something radically different: the economy of the emerging digital era. A History of the Internet and the Digital Future tells the story of the development of the Internet from the 1950s to the present, and examines how the balance of power has shifted between the individual and the state in the areas of censorship, copyright infringement, intellectual freedom and terrorism and warfare. Johnny Ryan explains how the Internet has revolutionized political campaigns; how the development of the World Wide Web enfranchised a new online population of assertive, niche consumers; and how the dot-com bust taught smarter firms to capitalize on the power of digital artisans. In the coming years platforms such as the iPhone and Android rise or fall depending on their treading the line between proprietary control and open innovation. The trends of the past may hold out hope for the record and newspaper industry. From the government-controlled systems of the Cold War to today's move towards cloud computing, user-driven content and the new global commons, this book reveals the trends that are shaping the businesses, politics and media of the digital future.
**
### Review
An immensely important book. ... This narrative reads like the digital equivalent of the Manhattan Project, with all the excitement of discovery, blind alleys, failure to see the obvious, and thinking beyond established norms. ... Wonderful, liberating quotes are threaded through this meticulous charting of a revolution by Johnny Ryan, in his own observations, and in those of others.   
\--Kevin O'Sullivan, Editor of *The Irish Times*  
### From the Back Cover
This story is about the death of the center and the development of commercial and political life in a networked system. It is also the story about the coming power of the networked individual as the new vital unit of effective participation and creativity. Understanding the trends revealed in this story is the key to adapting to the new global commons, a political and media system in flux, and the future of competitive creativity. 
This book takes the reader on a path through some of the most interesting events and documents of the last century, from President Kennedy's nuclear scenario war game planning, to Warran Buffet's I-told-you-so letter to shareholders in the aftermath of the dot com bust, this is not only a history, but like all good histories, tells us where we are bound in the future.

"Dear, Brian","Brian Dear","**The remarkable untold story of PLATO, the computer program and platform created in the 1960s, that marked the true beginning of cyberculture--a book that will rewrite the history of computing and the Internet 
**Here is the story of the brilliant, eccentric designers, developers, and denizens (often teenagers and twentysomethings) of the PLATO system, a computer network so far ahead of its time, and with a list of hardware and software innovations so long, that it's almost inconceivable that it actually existed--and existed so long ago--only to fade almost entirely from public view. The many thousands of people who used the system have held on to the PLATO ideas throughout their careers, influencing countless technological products and programs: from flat-panel wall TVs and touch-sensitive screens to chat rooms, instant messaging, screen savers, multiplayer games, flight simulators, crowdsourcing, interactive fiction, emoticons, and e-learning. Fascinating, first hand, and revelatory,* The Friendly Orange Glow* makes clear that the work of PLATO practitioners has profoundly shaped the computer industry from its inception to our very moment.   
     This book is as much the biography of a vision as it is the story of the people behind PLATO. Every technology story--whether it's about the steam engine, airplane, telephone, Model T, or more recently, Apple, Google, and Tesla electric car--has at its core a vision. It is the immutable nature of technology, and technology visions, to run full life cycles, from cradle to grave. PLATO's story is no different. Like all technology visions, PLATO grew outdated and was disrupted by competing visions. *The Friendly Orange Glow* is a revelatory paradigm for our technological age.

The lesser priests must locate the successor and educate him in his duties. When assassins from a rival cult kill the high priest, it should be a simple matter to locate the new candidate. But the portents make no sense the positions of the stars and planets at the time of the old priest's death indicate the new high priest will be born in the skies. In Canal Priests of Mars, one of the PCs has an unexpected heritage: the high priesthood of the Canal Priests of Mars. Being a high priest is not all chocolates and soft cushions. Every job has restrictions, and the high priest is not without obligations. Still, the lucky character can look forward to the fawning adulation of thousands of converts once the news gets out, the cult can begin recruiting members again. Of course, this is exactly what some people don't want...""

### About the Author
**Aditya Ravi Shankar**  started programming in 1993 when he was first introduced to the world of computers. With no access to the Internet or online tutorials at the time, he wrote his first game in GW-BASIC by painstakingly retyping code from a book he found at the local library.
After graduating from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2001, he spent nearly a decade working as a software consultant, developing trading and analytics systems for investment banks and large Fortune 100 companies, before eventually leaving his corporate life behind so he could focus on doing what he loved.
A self-confessed technology geek, he has spent the time since then working on his own projects and experimenting with every new language and technology that he could, including of course HTML5. During this time he became well known for singlehandedly re-creating the famous RTS game Command and Conquer, as well as Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines entirely in HTML5.
Apart from programming, Aditya is passionate about billiards, salsa dancing, fitness and personal development. He maintains a personal website where he writes articles on game programming, personal development, and billiards, as well as shares his popular game demos.
When he is not busy writing or working on his own projects, Aditya does consulting work with companies to help them launch new software products and games.
