        The Internet (at least in the US) is at a crossroads as the FCC is considering rolling back the net neutrality regulations it adopted in 2015.  If net neutrality is abolished, the Internet could shift from an essential service that all consumers can access to a product that can be packaged and sold to the highest bidders. Get to know the potential winners and losers on both sides of the issue.

      content: "In our final episode of season 1, we break from our usual format to
        host a big conversation. Recent events like the Charlottesville, VA rally
        have revealed the Internet\u2019s role in helping spread IRL threats and violence.
        Leaders in the tech world have represented varying positions on both protecting
        free speech and also reducing hate speech online.  Should tech companies regulate
        who says what on the Internet? Brandi Collins of Color of Change, Anil Dash
        of Fog Creek Software and Jillian York of the Electronic Frontier Foundation
        address this question and more with Veronica Belmont.\n"
