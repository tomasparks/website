      content: "We can hardly believe it, but as of this moment we've released 200
        episodes of the Techdirt podcast! For this milestone, we've brought the increasingly-rare
        original team of co-hosts back together for a bit of a meta-episode all about
        podcasts \u2014 specifically, the recent news that Spotify has acquired Gimlet
        Media for the impressive and, to many, surprising sum of $230-million. Mike
        joined by Dennis Yang and Hersh Reddy to discuss what Spotify might be up
        to, and just how big the podcasting business really is."
