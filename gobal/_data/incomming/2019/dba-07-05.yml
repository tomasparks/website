      author: Brian McCullough
      content: "Well, as we say in this episode, he\u2019ll always be known as the
        inventor of the hashtag, but Chris Messina has been central to so many things
        in tech over the last 20 years or so. Helped Mozilla launch Firefox. Founded
        BarCamp where so much Web 2.0 goodness happened and was launched. Cofounded
        the first co-working space in San Francisco. Helped Google try to grok social
        with Google+. Oh, and that hashtag business."

      name: 199. Is Tech Making Us- Bored, Lonely, Angry, Stupid?
      author: Brian McCullough
      content: 'Is technology really rotting our brains, destroying our society...
        or is that what everyone has always worried about with every technological
        advance, going back to tv, or telephones, or even writing letters? The new
        book, Bored, Lonely, Angry, Stupid: Changing Feelings about Technology, from
        the Telegraph to Twitter tries to look at this question from a historical
        perspective. Is it really different this time? But more importantly... to
        what degree has technological change impacted how we think of things, and
        vice-versa.My thanks to the authors, Luke Fernandez and Susan J. Matt.  For
