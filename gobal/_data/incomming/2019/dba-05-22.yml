      content: "We used to control our online identities, content, and experience.
        We now share Twitter names instead of domains; even web developers tweet and
        post on Medium instead of their own sites. We scroll social media and feel
        empty instead of reading news & blogs to feel informed and connected. Algorithmic
        feeds amplify rage & conspiracies, enabling tribal ad-targeting to polarise
        and spread misinformation, threatening democracy itself.\r\nWhat happened?
        And what are we doing to fix it?\r\nThat's a big question that will require
        all of us, our communities, our employers, to shift. I don't want to wait,
        and you probably don't either.\r\nWhat can you do for yourself, today?\r\nOwn
        your domain. Own your content. Own your social connections. Own your reading
        experience. IndieWeb services, tools, and standards enable you to take back
        your web.\r\n\r\n===\r\nOriginal video: https://vimeo.com/336343886\r\nDownloaded

      author: Techdirt
      content: "The topic of what (if anything) to do with Facebook was hardly fading
        from public discourse anyway, but it received a bump when co-founder Chris
        Hughes called for the company to be broken up. This week, we've got two returning
        guests on the podcast with plenty to say on the subject \u2014 UN Special
        Rapporteur on freedom of expression David Kaye, and famed internet lawyer
        Mike Godwin \u2014 to discuss the many sides of the Facebook question."
