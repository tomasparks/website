      content: "Everyone knows Karen Wickre, because she\u2019s one of those classic
        connectors. Once we finally got in touch, I wasn\u2019t surprised to learn
        we knew about half a dozen of the same people though we had never remotely
        crossed paths. But Karen knows everyone because she\u2019s popped up Zelig-like
        in a bunch of interesting places over the course of tech history over the
        last 30 years or so. Early tech journalism. Planet Out. Early Google employee.
        Early blogger. Early tweeter. Editorial Director at Twitter. Karen has a great
        book out that you should read, explaining how to do what she does so successfully,
        called Take The Work Out of Networking: An Introvert\u2019s Guide To Making
        Connections That Count."
