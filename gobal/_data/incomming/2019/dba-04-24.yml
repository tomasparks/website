      name: The Past & Future Of Section 230
      author: Techdirt
      content: Of all the laws we discuss here at Techdirt, probably none comes up
        as often or in relation to as many things as Section 230 of the Communications
        Decency Act. It's not an exaggeration to describe it the way Professor Jeff
        Kosseff does in the title of his new book, The Twenty-Six Words That Created
        The Internet, offering a detailed history of this vital piece of law. This
        week, Jeff joins us on the podcast for an in-depth discussion about where
        Section 230 came from, and where it's going.
