      content: "The Sorting Episode: A Life of Sorting, File Classifications, My Subdirectories, The Storage Unit, Photos and Movies and Boxes and Personal, The Actual Question, What the Actual Answer Might Be, An Empty Container. Plus: An Offer to Help Me Sort. A lot of people asked me to speak about my sorting method - I hope it's simple and straightforward how I approach things. I use this everywhere, and if I wanted to be a very bearded Marie Kondo, this is how I'd start to explain myself. Like all the other times I invite people into projects, the project mentioned at the end is going to be continual and the offer won't expire. Thanks for considering some help."
