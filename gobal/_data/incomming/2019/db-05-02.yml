      name: The Sorting Episode
      author: Jason Scott
      content: 'The Sorting Episode: A Life of Sorting, File Classifications, My Subdirectories,
        The Storage Unit, Photos and Movies and Boxes and Personal, The Actual Question,
        What the Actual Answer Might Be, An Empty Container. Plus: An Offer to Help
        Me Sort. A lot of people asked me to speak about my sorting method - I hope
        it''s simple and straightforward how I approach things. I use this everywhere,
        and if I wanted to be a very bearded Marie Kondo, this is how I''d start to
        explain myself. Like all the other times I invite people into projects, the
        project mentioned at the end is going to be continual and the offer won''t
        expire. Thanks for considering some help.'
