      name: A Policy Bootcamp For Technologists
      author: Techdirt
      content: There's a new but growing desire, both within the tech industry and
        among onlookers, for more technologists to get involved in public policy and
        doing work to serve the public interest. Various plans to help make this happen
        are starting to appear, and an especially interesting one is the Aspen Tech
        Policy Hub, which aims to help establish a new generation of tech policy entrepreneurs
        using an incubator model in the vein of Y Combinator. This week, Mike is joined
        by director Betsy Cooper to discuss the Hub's resources and programs, its
        inaugural cohort of technologists, and what comes next.

      author: Firefox, backed by Mozilla
      content: "\u20185G\u2019 is a new buzzword floating around every corner of the
        internet. But what exactly is this hyped-up cellular network, often referred
        to as the next technological evolution in mobile internet communications?
        Will it really be 100 times faster than what we have now? What will it make
        possible that has never been possible before? Who will reap the benefits?
        And, who will get left behind?\n\nMike Thelander at Signals Research Group
        imagines the wild ways 5G might change our lives in the near future. Rhiannon
        Williams hits the street and takes a new 5G network out for a test drive.
        Amy France lives in a very rural part of Kansas \u2014 she dreams of the day
        that true, fast internet could come to her farm (but isn\u2019t holding her
        breath). Larry Irving explains why technology has never been provided equally
        to everyone, and why he fears 5G will leave too many people out. Shireen Santosham,
        though, is doing what she can to leverage 5G deployment in order to bridge
        the digital divide in her city of San Jose. "
