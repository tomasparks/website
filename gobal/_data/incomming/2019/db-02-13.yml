      name: From Apple To The ACLU, With Jon Callas
      author: Techdirt
      content: Jon Callas has been at the forefront of computer security issues for
        a long time, most recently as the head of Apple's team of internal hackers
        that try to break into the company's own products. But just a couple of months
        ago, he made a change, and left Apple to work on tech policy at the ACLU.
        This week, he joins us on the podcast to discuss the new job, computer security
        policy, and the latest phase of the crypto-wars.
