      name: As the Internet divides
      author: ABC Radio National
      content: Analysts say that many countries and companies will soon be forced
        to make a decision between the Chinese version of the Internet and the liberal,
        Western model - both models have a very different underlaying philosophy and
        understanding of governance.

      name: Politicians (Usually) Don't Understand Technology
      author: Techdirt
      content: The regulation of technology is an extremely important issue that impacts
        all our lives, but it tends to take a back seat in the world of mainstream
        politics, and when it does come to the fore, the lack of knowledge on display
        among elected representatives can be... disheartening, to say the least. In
        some ways that's starting to change as a generation of people who grew up
        with modern technology gets more and more involved in politics, but we're
        still a long, long way away from having a majority of tech-savvy (or even
        tech-literate) lawmakers. This week, we're joined by lawyer and pioneering
        law blogger Denise Howell to discuss the challenge of even determining whether
        a politician knows what they are talking about when it comes to tech.
