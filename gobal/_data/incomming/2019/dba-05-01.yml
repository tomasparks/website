      content: "Whether it's from his novels, or his work for the EFF and others,
        most of you probably know all about Cory Doctorow. He last joined the podcast
        two years ago to discuss his book Walkaway, and this week he's back to talk
        about his latest book, Radicalized \u2014 a collection of four novellas, the
        first of which is directly based on the issues with the DMCA's anti-circumvention
        provisions. Check out the episode for a discussion about the book, anti-circumvention,
        tech companies, and more."
