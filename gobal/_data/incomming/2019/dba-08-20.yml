      name: What's Really In The FCC's Facebook Settlement, Part Two
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Last week, we featured part one of our discussion with lawyer Joshua
        de Larios-Heiman, about the details of the FCC's Facebook settlement, beyond
        the headline-grabbing fine. It was a long conversation that we cut off right
        in the middle, so be sure to listen to part one first and then come back for
        part two, in which we finish picking apart the settlement item by item.\r\n\r\nPART
