      content: "Episode 1 \u2013 in which a rumourmonger comes to town, and Kaylen
        fights a force that can\u2019t be slain by a sword. Grigori is (rightfully)
        famed as one of Kingmaker\u2019s more memorable encounters! System Matters:
        Interested in what\u2019s happening with the system you\u2019re listening
        to? (If not, stop reading now). This is a Pathfinder Adventure [\u2026]"
