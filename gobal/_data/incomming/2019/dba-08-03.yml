      author: Techdirt
      content: Moral panics are nothing new, but they've taken on many new forms in
        the internet era, and their patterns have rubbed off on other kinds of techno-panics.
        This week, I join Mike on the podcast to discuss the way we talk about the
        potentially scary aspects of tech, how to spot a tech panic, and how to start
        changing the conversation into something more constructive.

      name: Democracy and the Internet
      author: Firefox, backed by Mozilla
      content: "Part of celebrating democracy is questioning what influences it. In
        this episode of IRL, we look at how the internet influences us, our votes,
        and our systems of government. Is democracy in trouble? Are democratic elections
        and the internet incompatible? \n\nPolitico's Mark Scott takes us into Facebook's
        European Union election war room. Karina Gould, Canada's Minister for Democratic
        Institutions, explains why they passed a law governing online political ads.
        The ACLU's Ben Wizner says our online electoral integrity problem goes well
        beyond a few bad ads. The team at Stop Fake describes a massive problem that
        Ukraine faces in telling political news fact from fiction, as well as how
        they're tackling it. And NYU professor Eric Klinenberg explains how a little
        bit of offline conversation goes a long way to inoculate an electorate against
        election interference. \n\nIRL is an original podcast from Firefox. For more
        on the series go to irlpodcast.org"

      name: The Internet's Carbon Footprint
      author: Firefox, backed by Mozilla
      content: "Manoush Zomorodi explores the surprising environmental impact of the
        internet in this episode of IRL. Because while it\u2019s easy to think of
        the internet as living only on your screen, energy demand for the internet
        is indeed powered by massive server farms, running around the clock, all over
        the world. What exactly is the internet\u2019s carbon footprint? And, what
        can we do about it?\n\nMusic professor Kyle Devine considers the environmental
        costs of streaming music. Geophysicist and pop scientist Miles Traer takes
        his best shot at calculating the carbon footprint of the IRL podcast. Climate
        journalist Tatiana Schlossberg explores the environmental influence we don\u2019t
        know we have and what the web\u2019s got to do with it. Greenpeace\u2019s
        Gary Cook explains which tech companies are committed to renewable energy
        \u2014 and which are not. Kris De Decker tries powering his website with a
        homebrew solar power system. And, Ecosia's Chief Tree Planting Officer Pieter
        Van Midwoud discusses how his company uses online search to plant trees. \n\nIRL

      name: The Tech Worker Resistance
      author: Firefox, backed by Mozilla
      content: "There's a movement building within tech. Workers are demanding higher
        standards from their companies \u2014 and because of their unique skills and
        talent, they have the leverage to get attention. Walkouts and sit-ins. Picket
        protests and petitions. Shareholder resolutions, and open letters. These are
        the new tools of tech workers, increasingly emboldened to speak out. And,
        as they do that, they expose the underbellies of their companies' ethics and
        values or perceived lack of them. \n\nIn this episode of IRL, host Manoush
        Zomorodi meets with Rebecca Stack-Martinez, an Uber driver fed up with being
        treated like an extension of the app; Jack Poulson, who left Google over ethical
        concerns with a secret search engine being built for China; and Rebecca Sheppard,
        who works at Amazon and pushes for innovation on climate change from within.
        EFF Executive Director Cindy Cohn explains why this movement is happening
        now, and why it matters for all of us.\n\nIRL is an original podcast from
        Firefox. For more on the series go to irlpodcast.org"

      name: The "Privacy Policy" Policy
      author: Firefox, backed by Mozilla
      content: "Privacy policies: most apps and websites have them, buried away somewhere.
        These legal documents explain how the company collects, uses, and shares your
        personal data. But let's be honest, few of us actually read these things,
        right? And that passive acceptance says a lot about our complicated relationship
        with online privacy. \n\nIn the Season 5 premiere of IRL, host Manoush Zomorodi
        speaks with Charlie Warzel, writer-at-large with the New York Times, about
        our complicated relationship with data and privacy \u2014 and the role privacy
        policies play in keeping things, well, confusing. You'll also hear from Parker
        and Lila, two young girls who realize how gaming and personal data intersect.
        Rowenna Fielding, a data protection expert, walks us through the most efficient
        ways to understand a privacy policy. Professor Lorrie Cranor explains how
        these policies have warped our understanding of consent. And privacy lawyer
        Jenny Afia explains why \"privacy\" is a base element of being human. \n\n"
