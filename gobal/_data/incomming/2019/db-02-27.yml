      name: Can Journalism Survive A Free Market?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "It's no secret that journalism outfits are struggling, and have been
        for some time. There are lots of competing ideas about why this is the case,
        and who to blame, but the ultimate question is the same: how do we fund good
        journalism going forward? This week, Mike is joined on the podcast by someone
        whose opinions on this question differ significantly from his own \u2014 Columbia
        Journalism professor and former online editor-in-chief of the Guardian Emily
        Bell \u2014 to talk about whether journalism can survive the free market,
        and what the alternatives are."
