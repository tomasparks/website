      content: "I\u2019ve said before I wish I could cover technology history beyond
        just North America, more\u2026 Well, Charles Miller has started a great podcast
        in Britain called Tech Business History. Charles used to report on the tech
        business as a BBC documentary producer. In the first series of his podcast,
        he\u2019s exploring the dot com boom in the UK with some of the people he
        met when he was filming for the BBC back in 1999. It\u2019s a fantastic show
        that I\u2019ve fallen in love with, so what I want to do is play you an episode
        from his show that was amazing. It\u2019s exactly the sort of interview I
        wish I had gotten for this show: In the episode we\u2019re going to hear,
        he talks to Darryl Mattocks, the founder of a very early dot com called The
        Internet Bookshop. Yes, they were selling books on the internet before Jeff
        Bezos did. But I\u2019ll let Charles introduce his guest \u2013 in this episode
        of TBH \u2013 Tech Business History. And if you like it, do catch up with
        the other episodes on iTunes or from your podcast providerThe Tech Business
        History Podcast"
