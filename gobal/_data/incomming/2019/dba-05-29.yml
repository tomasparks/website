      name: What If Congress Actually Understood Technology?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Once upon a time, there was something called the Office of Technology
        Assessment, charged with the critical if unenviable task of educating members
        of congress about issues related to technology. Since that seems like a pretty
        good thing to have, recently some people have been pushing to re-establish
        the office. This week, we're joined by two of those people \u2014 Daniel Schuman
        from Demand Progress and returning guest Zach Graves from the Lincoln Network
        \u2014 for a discussion about bringing back the OTA."
