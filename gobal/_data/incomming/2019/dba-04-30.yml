      content: "The Infocom Source Code Episode: The Specialness of Infocom, The Craft,
        The Z-Machine, Z-Machine Glories, Full Sentences and Every Platform, GET LAMP,
        The Infocom .ZIP File, A Release, Stu Galley, Github, The Clones and Branches,
        Steve and Kevin have a chat. An episode about the release of the Infocom Source
        Code on Github. It's currently available on the HistoricalSource collection
        there:  https://github.com/historicalsource\_ The ZIL Language is now having
        a little renaissance and I hope to see some actual games come out of it. Until
        then, I'm not kidding - type in the name of any Infocom game and you can probably
        be playing it within seconds. I recommend a walk through the document Steve
        Meretzky wrote at Infocom to explain the ZIL source code here:  https://archive.org/details/Learning_ZIL_Steven_Eric_Meretzky_1995\_
        Here's the video of the chat with Steve and Kevin:  https://www.twitch.tv/videos/416801231\_"
