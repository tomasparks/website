      content: "Legendary computer scientist, web standards pioneer, and indie-web
        proponent Tantek \xC7elik is Jeffrey Zeldman\u2019s guest.\r\n\r\nThe secret
        history of standards in our web browsers. How web standards moved from academic
        ideas that sometimes couldn\u2019t even be implemented to the foundation of
        our modern web. The rift between standards-oriented, CSS-and-accessibility-loving
        web developers and those who rely on powerful and sophisticated toolchains:
        can it be bridged?\r\n\r\nThe Flash years and today. Indieweb tools and the
        independent web community: what it\u2019s about and how to get started. Readers
        versus social readers. Taking back privacy and the ownership of our content.\r\n\r\nhttp://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/186"
