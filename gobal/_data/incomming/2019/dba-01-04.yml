      content: "In late September, Mike joined a panel at the Lincoln Network's Reboot
        conference to tackle the question \"will rising activism limit government\u2019s
        access to Silicon Valley?\" along with Trae Stephens, Pablo E. Carrillo, with
        moderator Katie McAuliffe. For this week's episode, we've got the full audio
        from that panel plus an additional introduction from Mike with some thoughts
        after the fact. Enjoy!"

      content: This week, we've got a special cross-post from Rob Reid's excellent
        After On podcast. After a conversation between Mike and Rob about the possible
        end of the world, we pivot to the full episode of After On in which Rob talks
        to neuroscientist David Eagleman about his fascinating work using technology
        to create new human senses. We hope you enjoy it!

      author: Techdirt
      content: As artificial intelligence technology marches onwards, it's raising
        a lot of complicated questions about free speech, privacy, and important rights.
        One person who's been thinking a lot about these questions is David Kaye,
        the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to
        freedom of opinion and expression, who recently published a thorough report
        [pdf] on the subject. This week, David joins us on the podcast to discuss
        artificial intelligence and its implications for human rights.
