      name: What The Hell Is Initiative Q?
      author: Techdirt
      content: By now, there's a good chance you've received an invitation to join
        Initiative Q, and also a good chance that you took one look at it and thought
        "wow, this seems extremely sketchy." And indeed, there's little reason (other
        than hopefulness) to see the strange new proposed payment system as anything
        but a pyramid scheme. But it's got people talking, thanks in no small part
        to its viral marketing scheme, so this week's episode is all about trying
        to figure out just what Initiative Q really is.

      name: Should We Break Up Big Tech?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "A few weeks ago, we featured a panel discussion with Mike and others
        at the Lincoln Network's Reboot conference on the podcast. This week we're
        doing something a little different and featuring another panel discussion
        from that conference, but one in which Mike wasn't involved. Instead, it's
        an interesting \u2014 and at times contentious \u2014 debate about one big
        question: do the big tech firms need to be broken up?"

      name: Free Speech Disorder, With Mike Godwin
      author: Techdirt
      content: Last week, we published a series of posts by Mike Godwin looking at
        Our Bipolar Free Speech Disorder And How To Fix It (check out part one, part
        two, and part three). But with a topic like this, there's always more to dig
        into, so this week we've got Mike Godwin joining the podcast to take a closer
        look at his ideas about free speech in the digital era.
