      author: Techdirt
      content: "Bruce Schneier is a name most Techdirt readers are very familiar with

        up the mantle of Public Interest Technologist, and been exploring exactly
        what that means. This week, Bruce joins us on the podcast to discuss how technologists
        can dedicate themselves to the common good."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "Live streaming is here to stay, and it seems to be getting more popular
        by the minute \u2014 but for many people, it still seems like a foreign land
        and evokes a cliched \"I feel old\" response. This week, Mike is joined by
        not-so-regular-anymore co-host Dennis Yang, who has been experimenting with
        Twitch, to get a beginner's perspective on the platform, the community, and
        the medium of streaming."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "Josh Hawley's bill that aims to force \"political neutrality\" on
        social media platforms has caused a lot of stir for something so obviously
        unconstitutional and doomed to failure. There are so many problems with the
        bill that we've got three experts this week \u2014 Daphne Keller, Jeffrey
        Koseff, and Aaron Mackey \u2014 to help dig into all the ways this attack
        on Section 230 sucks."

      name: Outsourcing, automation and the messiness of global labour
      author: ABC Radio National
      content: Automation and outsourcing are dirty words for many people in Western
        countries worried about their future employment prospects. Developing countries
        are seen to be the major beneficiaries of off-shore labour, with multinationals
        hoovering up increased profits. But the reality is a lot more complex and
        even messy. Now, even developing countries are starting to feel the pain.
