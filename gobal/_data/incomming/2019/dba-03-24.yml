      name: Decentralize It
      author: Mozilla
      content: "Some people believe that decentralization is the inevitable future
        of the web. They believe that internet users will start to demand more privacy
        and authenticity of information online and that they\u2019ll look to decentralized
        platforms to get those things. But would decentralization be as utopian as
        advocates say it could be?\n\nHost Manoush Zomorodi  speaks to Eugen Rochko
        of Mastodon, an ad-free alternative to Twitter; Justin Hunter of Graphite
        docs, a decentralized alternative to GoogleDocs; Maria Bustillos who hopes
        to help eliminate fake news online through the Blockchain; David Irvine, the
        co-founder of MaidSafe who plans to make the centralized internet as we know
        it redundant; and Tom Simonite of WIRED, who comments on both the promise
        and also the pitfalls of decentralization.\n\nIRL is an original podcast from
        Mozilla, maker of Firefox and always fighting for you. For more on the series

      name: The Human Costs of Content Moderation
      author: Mozilla
      content: "What, if anything, should be banned from online media? And who should
        review violent and explicit content, in order to decide if it\u2019s okay
        for the public? Thousands of people around the world are working long, difficult
        hours as content moderators in support of sites like Facebook, Twitter, and
        YouTube. They are guided by complex and shifting guidelines, and their work
        can sometimes lead to psychological trauma. But the practice of content moderation
        also raises questions about censorship and free expression online.\n"

      name: What if women built the internet?
      author: Mozilla
      content: "All the things we love on the internet \u2014 from websites that give
        us information to services that connect us \u2014 are made stronger when their
        creators come with different points of view.  With this in mind, we asked
        ourselves and our guests: \"What would the internet look like if it was built
        by mostly women?\"\n\nWitchsy founders Kate Dwyer and Penelope Gazin start
        us off with a story about the stunt they had to pull to get their site launched
        \u2014 and counter the sexist attitudes they fought against along the way.
        Brenda Darden Wilkerson recalls her life in tech in the 80s and 90s and shares
        her experience leading AnitaB.org, an organization striving to get more women
        hired in tech. Coraline Ada Ehmke created the Contributor Covenant, a voluntary
        code of conduct being increasingly adopted by the open source community. She
        explains why she felt it necessary, and how it's been received; and Mighty
        Networks CEO Gina Bianchini rolls her eyes at being called a \"lady CEO,\"
        and tells us why diversifying the boardroom is great for business and innovation.\n"

      author: Mozilla
      content: "TL;DR: We have access to more things to read than ever before. Too
        much, in fact. Our reading habits have shifted. We skim a lot. We look for
        full stories baked into headlines. Our eyes bounce around from one article
        to the next, and we try and fail to manage how many things we read at once.
        Some of us can no longer concentrate on a book\u2014no matter how good it
        might be. Reading has changed. And we\u2019re changing alongside it.\n\nWith
        host Manoush Zomorodi, Derek Thompson at the Atlantic talks headlines; Ernie
        Smith from Tedium rails against our bad browser tab habits; librarian rock
        star Nancy Pearl makes the case for analog books; Beth Rogowsky discusses
        if audiobooks can replace reading; and Nate Weiner from Mozilla\u2019s Pocket
        shows us one way we can manage our reading overload. Happy New Year \u2014
        \ let\u2019s get working on that \u201CI will read more this year\u201D resolution.\n\nIRL

      name: The Surveillance Economy
      author: Mozilla
      content: "In her new book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Harvard Business
        School\u2019s Shoshana Zuboff argues that tech companies \u2014 like Google
        and Facebook \u2014 collect so much personal data for profit, that they\u2019re
        changing the fundamentals of our economy and way of life. And now these companies
        are learning to shape our behavior to better serve their business goals. Shoshana
        joins Manoush Zomorodi to explain what this all means for us.\n\nWe then explore
        whether or not it\u2019s time to end our relationship with corporate spies.
        OG advice columnist Dear Abby gives us some tips to start with. We chat with
        philosopher S. Matthew Liao. He asks if we have a moral duty to quit Facebook.
        Alice Marwick explains why most people won\u2019t leave the social network.
        And journalist Nithin Coca tells us what it was like for him to quit both
        Facebook and Google. Spoiler alert: it wasn\u2019t easy, but he has no regrets.\n\nIRL

      name: 192. Hulu's Founding and Digital Design With Dan Maccarone
      author: Brian McCullough
      content: Dan Maccarone is a digital design veteran, websites, products, strategy.
        He's got some amazing stories about the dotcom bubble, about the aftermath,
        and the rise of Web 2.0. He shares some unique design lessons but also, the
        story of the birth of Hulu, which I don't think has really been covered anywhere
        before.
