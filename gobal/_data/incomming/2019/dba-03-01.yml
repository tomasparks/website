      name: Decentralize It
      author: []
      content: "Some people believe that decentralization is the inevitable future
        of the web. They believe that internet users will start to demand more privacy
        and authenticity of information online, and that they\u2019ll look to decentralized
        platforms to get those things. But would decentralization be as utopian as
        advocates say it could be?\r\n\r\nHost Manoush Zomorodi speaks to Eugen Rochko
        of Mastodon, an ad-free alternative to Twitter; Justin Hunter of Graphite
        docs, a decentralized alternative to GoogleDocs; Maria Bustillos who hopes
        to help eliminate fake news online through the Blockchain; David Irvine, the
        co-founder of MaidSafe who plans to make the centralized internet as we know
        it redundant; and Tom Simonite of WIRED, who comments on both the promise
        and also the pitfalls of decentralization.\r\n\r\nhttps://irlpodcast.org/season4/episode6/"

      author: Jason Scott
      content: 'The Cowicature Episode: I Needed the Money, Two Pens and Paper, Sketch
        the Cow, Harvard Square, Territories, No Woman No Cry, What Caricatures Are,
        Very Little Udder Assault, The Clown, Street Vendor Shutdown.  I spent a couple
        summers doing caricatures for money out as a street performer. Here''s my
        thoughts on that. Before anybody asks, this sort of skill atrophies incredibly
        quickly, so I can''t do it any more (people have tried to get me to do it).
        I took the time that would have been spent on my artist game and moved into
        movie making and computers, and while it''s sad I let that talent go, I did
        some other good stuff with it!  I idly looked up how street performing did
        after we got flushed out, and it turns out that this year, this year, they
        just changed the rules and policies regarding performing and fees and technically,
        I could start up again! (But I''m not going to: Kind of busy.)'
