      content: ":'-) Ever wonder why emoticons exist? They popped up in the 1980s
        to make online connections feel a little less digital and a little more personal
        :D. In this episode of IRL, host Veronica Belmont and special guest Peter
        Rojas explore how the Internet is both building and also confusing our relationships
        every day. Chloe Stuart-Ulin gives a first-hand account of her life as a \u201Ccloser\u201D
        for an online-dating service; we hear a dramatic, real-life story about a
        woman who finds her biological parent online; and Emma Brockes talks about
        how we can all maintain humanity while interacting with others on the internet.\n\nIRL
