      content: 'The 50th Episode: A Short Review of How We Got Here, What the Podcast
        Has Done For Me, Another Kind of 50, 50 More, Thank You. 50 podcast episodes
        have been released for this series. It''s a milestone, and something I''m
        happy to have been part of for the last year and a half. Thank you for supporting
        this and helping me dig out of the mess and get straight in a financial way.  As
        I say in the episode, I''m continuing this podcast until it doesn''t make
        sense to, or when I run out of what to talk about. Taking bets on which of
        those happen first.  Thank you again.'

      content: 'The Kickstarter Episode: Successful Sabbatical, Starting a Three-Pack,
        What Happened, A Job To Be Me, The Sacrifice, The End, The Loot, The Beginning.
        After a lot of thought and a number of sleepless nights, I ended the kickstarter
        campaign that I''ve had running for seven years. I thought I would talk about
        what inspired me to go about it in the first place, what went wrong, and what
        I''ve learned.'
