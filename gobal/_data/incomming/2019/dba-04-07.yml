      name: 193. The Home Page Film With Doug Block
      author: Brian McCullough
      content: "20 years ago, the acclaimed documentarian Doug Block released a landmark
        film, Home Page. Doug\u2019s documentary accidentally chronicled the birth
        of blogging, featuring several people we\u2019ve talked to on this very show,
        including Justin Hall. But the documentary also captured a moment in time,
        the web going mainstream, the beginnings of the dotcom bubble, the early days
        of Wired, Hotwired and Suck and also so many of the things I ask people about
        on here regularly. How people learned to live online, to begin to port all
        of modern life over to the digital. Well, Home Page is celebrating its 20th
        anniversary with a re-release, and starting this week, you can watch it yourself
        everywhere films are gettable, including iTunes. Today we speak to Doug Block
        about this amazing movie that I think is one of the best historical records
        of the era we have been interrogating for nearly 5 years on this podcast.
        Go watch Home Page yourself, and check out The D-word, Doug\u2019s community
        for documentarians, at D-word.com."
