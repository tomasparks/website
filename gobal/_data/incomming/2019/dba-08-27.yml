      content: "The word \u201Cregulation\" gets tossed around a lot. And it\u2019s
        often aimed at the internet\u2019s Big Tech companies. Some worry that the
        size of these companies and the influence they wield is too much. On the other
        side, there\u2019s the argument that any regulation is overreach \u2014 leave
        it to the market, and everything will sort itself out. But over the last year,
        in the midst of this regulation debate, a funny thing happened. Tech companies
        got regulated. And our right to privacy got a little easier to exercise. \n\nGabriela
        Zanfir-Fortuna gives us the highlights of Europe\u2019s sweeping GDPR privacy
        law, and explains how the law netted a huge fine against Spain\u2019s National
        Football League. Twitter\u2019s Data Protection Officer, Damien Kieran explains
        how regulation has shaped his new job and is changing how Twitter works with
        our personal data. Julie Brill at Microsoft says the company wants legislators
        to go further, and bring a federal privacy law to the U.S. And Manoush chats
        with Alastair MacTaggart, the California resident whose work led to the passing
        of the California Consumer Privacy Act. "
