      name: What's Really In The FTC's Facebook Settlement, Part One
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Ever since the FCC announced its proposed settlement with Facebook,
        the headlines have focused on the largest-ever privacy fine that came with
        it \u2014 but few people paid attention to the many, many important details.
        This week, we've got the first half of a two-part podcast with lawyer Joshua
        de Larios-Heiman, who helps us go through the entire settlement from start
        to finish, and pick apart what it means."
