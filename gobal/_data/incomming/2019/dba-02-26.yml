      content: "We\u2019ve had a couple of people come on here to discuss how the
        New York Times got online, but the spiritual yin to their yang is the Wall
        Street Journal and we haven\u2019t done enough to explore their path to embracing
        the internet. It\u2019s worth doing that because they embraced a different
        model from basically day one. Almost alone among the web media pioneers, the
        Journal went the subscription route. So, we\u2019re going to talk to Rich
        Jaroslovksy, who headed the team that brought the Journal online, to see why
        they went that route, to learn about the path to the web and much more."
