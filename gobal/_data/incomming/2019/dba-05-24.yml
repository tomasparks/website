      content: 'The Conference Episode: A Question by Jim Richardson, Gatherings,
        The Idea of a Conference, Why It Took Forever For Me To Attend a Conference,
        Why Conferences are Hard, Oh Yes The Question, Virtual Conferences, ConfCon,
        Why We Go, 1.2 Million of 2 Billion, Thanks MuseumNEXT and ACMI. An episode
        that''s answering a question Jim Richardson of Museum NEXT posited, which
        I thought everyone should listen to, and also my bigger thoughts on what conferences
        are about as well as personal history behind a few of them. I mentioned ConfCon
        was online. What I should say is that ConfCon WAS online, then the sites went
        down, and I thought I had them on textfiles.com but I don''t easily see them,
        so then Famicoman to the rescue and they''re both on Internet Archive: https://archive.org/details/confcon2009audio
        https://archive.org/details/confcon2010audio That was a close one!'
