      name: Blame Fox News Before Facebook
      author: Techdirt
      content: "In all the attempts to understand just what happened with the 2016
        election, a lot of blame has fallen on the internet and especially on Facebook.
        The attention, which often focuses on the Cambridge Analytica scandal and
        Russian interference, is not unwarranted \u2014 but it often seems to lose
        track of the fact that Facebook is just one part of a broader media ecosystem,
        and not necessarily the most important one. This week, we're joined by Yochai
        Benkler of the Berkman Klein Center to discuss why Fox News, not Facebook,
        might deserve the lion's share of scrutiny."
