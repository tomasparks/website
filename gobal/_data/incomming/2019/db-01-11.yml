      name: How Private Agreements Recreated SOPA
      author: Techdirt
      content: One of the most dangerous aspects of SOPA and other copyright proposals
        is the idea of moving enforcement and liability further down the stack of
        technology that powers the internet, even all the way to the DNS system. Although
        SOPA's DNS-blocking proposals were heavily criticized and the bill ultimately
        defeated, the idea of deep-level copyright enforcement has lived on and been
        implemented without changes to the law. This week our returning guest, law
        professor Annemarie Bridy, discusses how private agreements have quietly recreated
        some of the worst aspects of SOPA.
