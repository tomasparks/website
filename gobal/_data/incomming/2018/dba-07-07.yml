      name: Wi-fi is watching us
      author: ABC Radio National
      content: Many of us access the internet, and the world wide web, via wi-fi.
        Wi-fi lets us into a fabulous world of shared knowledge and social interaction.
        On the flip side, it seems that wi-fi can look at us, and perhaps even spy
        on us. It can even recognize moving humans on the other side of a wall. And
        this happens by examining not the content of the wi-fi signal, but its strength
        and timing.

      name: Is air conditioning sexist?
      author: ABC Radio National
      content: For 50 years air conditioning in commercial buildings has been set
        using the Standard 55 guidelines. But many workplaces aren't staffed solely
        with 40-year-old men dressed in 60s business suits, and that's left women
        out in the cold, as Dr Karl Kruszelnicki argues.
