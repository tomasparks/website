      content: "Lisa Napoli got a job straight out of college at CNN in its earliest
        days, which is a crazy startup story in it\u2019s own right. But then she
        worked for a time at Delphi, which was an early online service and competitor
        to AOL and Prodigy that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve covered much here before.
        And then she helped bring the NYTimes online with CyberTimes, which, as she
        said, is forgotten to history even by the New York Times. Then on to MSNBC,
        a crazy hybrid tech and media startup that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve discussed
        much either. There\u2019s just so many great stories here. Please enjoy this
        conversation with Lisa Napoli.\r\n      "
