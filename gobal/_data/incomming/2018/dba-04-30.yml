      content: "Jason Kottke, of kottke.org fame, was one of the early bloggers, one
        of the first bloggers to go pro, and one of the few solo bloggers still going.
        If you know Kottke.org, then you love it. How could you not? If you\u2019ve
        never heard of it, you can thank me later. This episode examines what it means
        to be a publisher on the web for 20 years as well as the discipline required
        to find cool stuff on the web every single day (almost)."

      content: "Its been over a week since the last episode. I\u2019ve been really
        busy with work and family and\u2026 you know\u2026 life! Its been a bit stressful,
        honestly, and that\u2019s what this episode is all about. Its a big shift
        from the first few episodes, but this time, I talk a bit about my brain, and
        my efforts to get more mentally and physically healthy.\n\n\n\n"
