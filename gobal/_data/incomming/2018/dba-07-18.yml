        who lives in the Washington DC area, and he is working on several interesting
        projects, including Indigenous, an iOS app that provides an interface for
        the IndieWeb. Jean was grateful that Eddie could make the time to chat, especially
        as he is also a father-to-be whose child is due this week!\r\n\r\nhttp://monday.micro.blog/2018/07/16/eddiehinkle.html"
