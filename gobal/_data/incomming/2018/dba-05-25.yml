      author: Techdirt
      content: "Smartphones have been one of the most world-changing innovations of
        our time \u2014 and for a long time, smartphone design was a hotbed of innovation.
        But more recently that innovation seems to have stagnated. So where does this
        technology go next? That's the subject of this weeks episode, in which we
        try to figure out whether smartphone innovation is still happening."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "This week's episode is all about copyright and culture, with a pair
        of the best guests you could ask for on the subject. Almost ten years ago,
        law professors Keith Aoki, James Boyle and Jennifer Jenkins released a comic
        book about copyright called Bound By Law, and now they are back with a sequel:
        Theft: A History of Music. This week, James and Jennifer join us to discuss
        the new comic and the history of copyright and music (with lots of fair use
        music snippets to demonstrate the legacy of 'theft')!\r\n\r\nYou should also
        be sure to check out the comic itself! You can download a digital copy for
        free of course, but for those who want to get their hands on the beautiful
        paperback edition, we've got a limited time offer for Techdirt fans: you can
        get it for only $8.99 at Createspace (that's 40% off!) when you use the discount
        code 2FESBPRQ within the next two weeks. It's also available on Amazon with
        a free Kindle edition included when you buy."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "We've made FOIA requests several times over the years, with varying
        results \u2014 but there are others out there who have dedicated their careers
        to understanding and using the FOIA process. One such person is Jason Leopold,
        a Buzzfeed reporter and FOIA litigator who was dubbed a \"FOIA terrorist\"
        by the government. He joins us this week on the podcast to discuss the ins
        and outs of Freedom Of Information."

      name: Re-Decentralizing The Web
      author: Techdirt
      content: One of the fundamental strengths of the internet has always been its
        decentralization, but over time we've seen a bunch of different forces start
        to distort this setup. This week, we're joined by Jamie King, director of
        Steal This Film and host of the Steal This Show podcast to discuss the ongoing
        efforts to restore the decentralization of the web.

      author: Techdirt
      content: "When the \"death of the MP3\" started being reported, we were among
        the very few blogs that said umm, no \u2014 but the deluge of eulogies for
        the still-thriving format has been overwhelming and quite surprising. This
        week I join the podcast to discuss why the MP3 isn't dead, and how so much
        of the tech press got it so wrong."

      author: Techdirt
      content: 'You may have heard the joke: the best way to do product design for
        Facebook is to get a job at Snapchat. We''ve all seen how, after failing to
        buy the company, Facebook has wasted little time in building its own versions
        of most of Snapchat''s key features. So... is this a problem? That''s the
        subject on this week''s episode, were we discuss the ins and outs of this
        kind of copying and what it might mean for the future of social media.'
