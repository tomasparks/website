      author: Techdirt
      content: "Just over a year ago, when Pok\xE9mon Go was taking the world by storm,
        we dedicated an episode of the podcast to discussing what made it so successful,
        and ended up with some differing predictions about what its future would be.
        Now, with the hype long and truly over but the game still far from dead (though
        just how far is up for debate), it's time to revisit the subject and figure
        out who, if anyone, was right about the future of Pok\xE9mon Go.\r\n\r\nHear
        the original episode: https://soundcloud.com/techdirt/is-it-the-pokemon-or-the-go-that-matters"

      name: When Godwin's Law Met The Streisand Effect
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Last Friday on Techdirt, we posted video from the World Hosting Days,
        in which Mike Masnick sat down for a talk with Mike Godwin \u2014 a.k.a. the
        originator of \"the Streisand Effect\" meeting the creator of \"Godwin's Law\".
        As promised, we've got the audio from the event for this week's podcast, so
        if you haven't watched the video (or you just want to revisit it) tune in
        for a fun discussion about the history and changing meaning of these now-famous
        terms.\r\n\r\nWatch the video: https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170915/16541938217/when-godwins-law-met-streisand-effect.shtml"

      content: 'While the 20th century was defined by mass production, since the digital
        revolution there has been talk about what might be the main trend of the 21st
        century: mass customization. Today, we''re starting to see customizable mass-produced
        offerings pop up in a number of spaces such as apparel, and this week we discuss
        whether mass customization is finally approaching critical mass.'
