      name: 139. The Napster Story with Jordan Ritter
      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: 'Napster was an incredible phenomenon, reaching tens of millions of
        users at its height, and though Jordan Ritter didn''t invent Napster, he very
        much was responsible for scaling it and turning it into the phenomenon it
        became. In today''s episode, Jordan recounts the entire Napster story, from
        its gestation in the w00w00 hacker collective (which, by the way, people talk
        a lot about the PayPal mafia, but an argument can be made for a w00w00 mafia)
        all the way through Napster''s legal descent into oblivion. '
