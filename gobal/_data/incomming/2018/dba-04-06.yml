        What once seemed like a fringe movement, conspiracy theories appear more pervasive than ever. Our guest Dr. Daniel Jolley points out, conspiracy theories have been around for centuries; social media, however, has given them a wider platform and megaphone. Believing in such theories can seem like harmless speculation. But if enough people accept ideas like the faking of the moon landing or 9/11 being a government inside job, they'll feel they have no agency. This can lead to very dangerous effects like lower voter turnout and less civic engagement at large. Daniel, who appeared on Adam Ruins Conspiracy Theories, explains why people believe in conspiracy theories in the first place, how people can believe in two contradictory conspiracy theories, and how we can combat these theories to create a healthier democracy. He studies conspiracy theories at Staffordshire University in the United Kingdom.

      content: "Placebos are commonly dismissed as \"fake\" treatments that have no
        real power on you or your body. But scientists are realizing more and more
        that placebos are more powerful than we realized. New research shows that
        while placebos may not cure diseases, they can reduce symptoms of our ailments
        like irritable bowel syndrome and even Parkinson's disease, and in the process
        actually make us feel better. Even traditional medicine takes advantage of
        the placebo effect, which could mean the placebo effect could play a significant
        role in treating diseases. On this episode we talk to Dr. Kathryn Hall, who
        appeared on Adam Ruins Spa Day, about how placebos can have such powerful
        effects on our brains and how placebos are changing the way we conduct science
        and treat patients. Kathryn is a molecular biologist and Director of Placebo
        Genetics at Harvard Medical School's Program in Placebo Studies.\r\n\r\nAdam

      name: 'Ep 43: Professor Teresa Ghilarducci on the Future of 401(k)s'
      author: Adam Ruins Everything
      content: "As humans, our inclination is to live in the present - not save 40
        years down the line - which makes saving money for retirement hard. In the
        90s many companies began offering 401(k) programs, a retirement savings plan
        sponsored by an employer which lets workers save and invest a piece of their
        paycheck before taxes. It seemed like the perfect solution to our retirement
        woes. But 401(k)s aren't the full proof saving plan we once thought. Even
        judiciously setting aside money in a 401(k) might not be enough to maintain
        one's lifestyle into retirement. There are also so many outside factors that
        can still diminish one's savings, including unexpected healthcare costs, recessions,
        or lost jobs. So how do we set ourselves up for a secure financial future?\r\n\r\nOur
        guest Professor Teresa Ghilarducci, who appeared on Adam Ruins the Future,
        is going to tell us how we entered into this financial mess and how we can
        get out of it. She suggests we do the best we can to save through 401(k)s,
        live within our means, start planning our financial future as young as we
        can, delay collecting social security as much as we can, and vote for representatives
        who can help reform this system. Teresa is a labor economist and nationally-recognized
        expert in retirement security. She's also a professor of economics at The
        New School for Social Research.\r\n\r\nAdam is on Twitter @AdamConover and
