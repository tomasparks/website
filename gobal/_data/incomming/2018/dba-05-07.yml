      content: "Coming into this episode I didn't really know much about service workers.
        I assumed there were very specific use cases for them, but Jeremy opened our
        eyes to the fact that they allow access to some very powerful browser features
        and are useful across the board.\n\nWe also spoke about Jeremy's recently
        released A Book Apart Book 'Going Offline', I'm really enjoying it. I can't
        put it any better than Sarah Drasner (https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com), who
        said:\n\n\"Jeremy Keith explains service workers with kindness, clarity, and
        humour in his new book, a must-read for any web developer who wants to learn
        this exciting new API and enable offline experiences for their applications.\"\n\nThe
        first chapter is available as an A List Apart article, link below. \n\nThere
        were some strong Jukebox Entries this time. Jeremy Chose Catastrophe And The
        Cure by Explosions In The Sky, from one of my very favourite albums. Ben chose
        The Celestial Garden by DrumTalk but apparently described a different track
        in the episode, he's a sleep deprived new dad so we'll have mercy on him for
        that. My pick was Bashed Out by This Is The Kit, a lovely bitter sweet track.
        \n\nJeremy's and Ben's tracks are added to the Relative Paths Playlist (https://relativepaths.uk/pl),
        mine goes on the Relative Paths Alt Playlist (http://relativepaths.uk/altpl)
        for tracks with lyrics.\n\nJeremy also plays slide bouzouki for Brighton based
        band Salter Cane. Link to their site is below, I'd definitely recommend giving
        them a listen.\n\nLinks: \nJeremy's Site - https://adactio.com\nGoing Offline,

      content: "After announcing it intends to divest from the International Space
        Station in 2025, NASA quietly released a new report on its transition plans,
        laying out a series of principles that will set the future of U.S. astronauts
        in low-Earth orbit. Can a private entity really take over the space station?
        Where did this idea come from anyway? Will there be new commercial space stations
        in the near future, and will they serve NASA's needs? Also, the confirmation
        of Jim Bridenstine as NASA Administrator. More resources to explore this month\u2019s

        The party picks up a new ally...literally. Nathan Yaffe (Drawfee/CollegeHumor) joins the Band of Boobs on a quest to track down a mythical being that could hold the answers to their burning questions: Who are Hardwon's parents?
