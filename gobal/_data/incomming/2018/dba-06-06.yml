        of all time: AOL - Time Warner. Who doesn\u2019t remember the soothing sounds
        of 56k modems and the timeless phrase, \u201CYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201D? Join
        us all as we unpack how one of the biggest ISP\u2019s of the 90\u2019s tried

        other companies\n*  Steve Case foreseeing the coming era of broadband, inspiring
        AOL to pursue working with a cable company\n*  Ebay vs. Time Warner in a down-to-the-wire
        war for a merger with AOL\n*  Why the money dried up for AOL after their merger
        with Time Warner\n*  AOL and its value in the post-Time-Warner era\n*  Speculating
