      author: Techdirt
      content: "If you're a Techdirt reader or just a general regular on the ol' internet,
        our topic this week \u2014 the current situation with net neutrality and the
        FCC \u2014 needs little introduction. And we've got two very special guests
        joining us to discuss it: former FCC Chair Tom Wheeler (author of the rules
        that Ajit Pai is currently undoing) and his former advisor Gigi Sohn (who
        joined us on the podcast in February to predict pretty much exactly what is
        now happening). There are few people as qualified to talk about these issues,
        so enjoy this week's episode looking at Trump's FCC and the future of the
        internet as we know it."

      name: The Perils Of Internet Platform Regulation
      author: Techdirt
      content: "We've been talking about internet platform regulation for a long time,
        but in the past year these issues have gotten a huge amount of increased focus
        \u2014 for a bunch of fairly obvious reasons. But a lot of people who are
        fairly new to the issue tend to make a lot of questionable assumptions and
        jump to some problematic conclusions, so this week we're joined by someone
        who has been studying these questions for many years \u2014 Annemarie Bridy,
        a law professor at the University of Idaho and Affiliate Scholar at the Stanford
        University Center for Internet and Society \u2014 to discuss the complicated
        consequences of various attempts to regulate online platforms."
