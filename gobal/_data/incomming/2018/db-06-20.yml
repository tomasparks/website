      name: Debating Steam's New Hands-Off Policy
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Recently, Valve sent waves through the PC gaming world by announcing
        an upcoming policy change for its Steam platform: it will no longer enforce
        specific content rules and will allow all games as long as they aren't illegal
        or \"straight-up trolling\". Though it's not exactly clear what this means,
        the reaction from the gaming press has been largely negative, and it's hard
        to say how the new policy will be implemented \u2014 so this week myself,
        Tim Geigner and Cathy Gellis join the podcast to discuss just what's going
        to happen on the biggest platform for PC games."
