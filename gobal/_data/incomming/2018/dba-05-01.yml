      name: Is "Free" Bad?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "In the last few years, a lot of the conversation around technology
        in general has shifted its focus from excitement about the obvious benefits
        to concern about its downfalls and side effects. It even feels like there's
        a general sense that \"technology is bad for society\" in a lot of places.
        This comes with a lot of associated myths, including the prominent idea that
        \"if you're not paying for something, you're the product being sold\" \u2014
        an idea that is, at best a massive oversimplification. So on this week's podcast
        we're discussing the changing cultural attitudes towards technology, especially
        free online services and the many myths and misunderstandings about how they
        operate."

      content: 'You''ve seen it from rom-coms to Hallmark cards - our society is obsessed
        with everyone finding their soulmate. But did you know the idea of ''the one''
        is a relatively new concept in our culture? In fact, marriage and love were
        completely separate entities '
