      name: Death Knell For Software Patents
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Software patents have been dubious since their inception \u2014 not
        just in principle, but legally too. Past rulings have called their validity
        into serious question, and now an opinion from a prominent pro-patent judge
        has called for people to admit that they simply shouldn't exist. This week,
        we discuss what this opinion means for the (hopefully short) future of software
        patents."

      name: Can Tech Be Trusted Without Antitrust?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Monopolies are one of the areas that even the most staunchly anti-regulation
        folks often agree there is a role for government intervention. In the world
        of tech, multiple big antitrust fights have broken out and continue to rage
        in both America and the EU \u2014 but how effective is this kind of regulation
        and how often should it really happen? This week, we discuss whether or not
        there is a role for antitrust in the world of technological innovation."

      name: Is There A Better Way To Pick A President?
      author: Techdirt
      content: 'Well, today''s the day. By tomorrow there will be a new President
        of the United States, and a large segment of the population claiming that
        they were robbed by the system. But immediate anger aside, that system is
        hardly above criticism: the Electoral College has had all sorts of unanticipated
        and often undesirable effects on democracy, and a wide variety of alternatives
        have been proposed. This week we discuss the question: is there a better way
        to pick the president?'

      name: Debating The Facebook Filter Bubble, With Mathew Ingram
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Though the notion of the Facebook \"filter bubble\" has been around
        for a while, it's picked up a huge amount of steam following the election
        of Donald Trump \u2014 perhaps just a little too much steam. While Techdirt
        has long been of the opinion that pointing fingers at Facebook is misguided,
        there are plenty of people who disagree. This week, we're joined by one such
        person \u2014 long-time media commentator and senior editor at Fortune Mathew
        Ingram \u2014 for a lively debate about just how much of a problem the filter
        bubble really is, and how you'd go about solving it."
