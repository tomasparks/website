      name: Luck In Silicon Valley, With Robert Frank
      author: Techdirt
      content: Innovation isn't easy, but success in Silicon Valley involves a bigger
        dose of luck than a lot of entrepreneurs seem prepared to admit. Chance gets
        left out of the economic equation all too often, and this week we're joined
        by Mike's own Econ 101 professor from Cornell, Robert Frank, to discuss the
        role of luck in the world of entrepreneurs and innovation.

      content: "We've talked about author Rob Reid many times on Techdirt, and had
        him on the podcast once before. Now, in what started as a project to promote
        his latest novel, Reid is hosting a podcast called After On, which tackles
        some pretty crazy real-world topics \u2014 from alien life to mind-reading
        technology \u2014 befitting a science fiction writer. This week, he returns
        to our podcast to discuss what it's like interviewing big thinkers about mind-bending
        ideas."
