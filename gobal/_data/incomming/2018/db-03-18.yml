      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: You might know him as Rob Malda, or you might know him as CmdrTaco,
        but he was the founder of the great geek social website Slashdot. Slashdot
        recently turned 20 years old, Rob commemorated this in a great Medium post,
        and so I reached out to him to tell us the story of one of the first great
        social media websites.

      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: 'Gregg Spiridellis has been making things go viral on the web since
        before the term VIRAL was even a thing. His company, JibJab has been producing
        web videos since the dialup dotcom era, producing hits you might remember
        such as Elf Yourself, Nasty Santa and This Land Is Your Land. JibJab has survived
        the dotcom bust, the coming of broadband, the coming of YouTube, the coming
        of social media and the mobile internet. '

      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: It gets my goat that these days, the history of ecommerce begins and
        ends with Amazon. There were so many companies and big ideas that got us where
        we are today, and one of the most important companies was Open Market. Jeff
        Bussgang is here to tell us the (today) often overlooked story of the earliest
        days of trying to sell stuff on the web. Today, Jeff is a General Partner
        at Flybridge Capital Partners.

      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: "Plato was an online and interactive learning computer system developed
        in the 1960s at the University of Illinois. But in the early 1970s, Plato
        got truly networked, and the users took over. Plato had already pioneered
        such things as touch screen computing, but the kids introduced and pioneered
        concepts like forums, message boards, e-mail, chat rooms, instant messaging,
        multiplayer games and even emoticons/emojis were pioneered on the Plato system.\r\n\r\nBuy

      content: "David Pakman is a well respected venture capitalist at Venrock, but
        also a lifelong musician and music fan. Earlier in his career he played a
        significant role in bringing music to the web. David tells us about cofounding
        Apple\u2019s Music Group, his role in facilitating the first digital sales
        of music online at dotcom-era companies N2K and MyPlay, and competing directly
        against iTunes when he was at eMusic. As a bonus, he gives us some background
        on the more recent founding story of Dollar Shave Club."
