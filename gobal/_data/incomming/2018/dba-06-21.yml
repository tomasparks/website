      content: "Ben & David break down Jet.com\u2019s meteoric rise, culminating in
        Walmart\u2019s blockbuster $3B+ acquisition of the company just two years
        after its founding. Will we look back on this deal as an \u2018Instagram-like\u2019
        bargain or a \u2018Pets.com'-sized blunder? And most importantly, can *anyone*
        compete with Amazon going forward? We speculate wildly.  Topics covered include:
        \ - Community spotlight: Nowdue, a super fast invoicing platform for teams
        on Slack. Invoice like it\u2019s the future! This looks very cool. - Jet\u2019s

        and Quidsi (aka, diapers.com) - Lore\u2019s chance run-in with Jeff Bezos
        at a school picnic in Seattle in the early 2000\u2019s - Amazon's dramatic
        acquisition of Quidsi in 2010, including Bezos\u2019 admonition to Amazon
        corp dev to keep Quidsi from being bought by Walmart under any circumstances
        (covered well in The Everything Store) - Lore\u2019s less-than-favorable opinion
        of Amazon's culture - Lore's vision of Jet as an \u2018online Costco\u2019
        that can directly with Amazon on price by selling goods to a \u201Chuge middle-class
        of people\" at effectively zero margin, and make profit on membership fees
        - Jet\u2019s huge, pre-launch fundraising rounds, and subsequent massively
        promoted public launch in July 2015 - Jet\u2019s pivot in October 2015 to
        drop the membership model (their only profit engine), and subsequent massive
        growth (but also accompanying massive losses) - 'Admitting defeat\u201D to
        Amazon in July 2016? Immediately followed by the blockbuster $3B+ Walmart

        Is Marc Lore Walmart\u2019s only hope? - Fantastic interview with Tim Cook
