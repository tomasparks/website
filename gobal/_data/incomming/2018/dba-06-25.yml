      content: "Episode #216 \u2013 Best Compo Tracks from 20 years of Evoke\r\nTwo
        decades of Evoke... Oh boy, that means countless hours of great compo music
        and the birth of many genius and creative talents. Artists who know how to
        deliver a great listening experience or who successfully experimented in a
        silly and funny way. Long before KEVIN we heard about a fountain called Jockel.
        We learned that Paniq doesn't need any instruments for making music. Enjoying
        phat beats from glxblt, Bitch or dq was as awesome as hearing the comeback
        of legendary BitArts. Also don't forget Crome, who can do the chip-style as
        good as heavy metal music. These all are moments we'd like to share with you
        again in this episode, featuring the best compo tracks from 20 years of Evoke!\r\n\r\nMixed
