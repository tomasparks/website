        emotional modulation to see how it comes off. It''s about two different camps
        I went to as a kid, as well as how it all wrapped in with computers and my
        desires to at once escape and be part of something.  I''ve been really enjoying
        these sessions at Beacon Soundworks, who have been dealing with my flexible
        schedule and near-random recording sessions with a truly professional air.
        Mike, the owner, is a gem; I''m delighted to work with him to book these times.
        I''m getting good feedback from folks, and the notes are always appreciated.
        Thanks for listening, spread the word.'

      author: Jason Scott
      content: Andy. With the close of the year comes the exciting prospect of how
        next year's taxes will be handled. Naturally, I'll be having an accountant
        help me. I bring this up as I have multiple times in the past because I've
        run into a number of people who have tax issues who are some sort of ashamed
        that they're experiencing problems or bumps, and feel in some way this makes
        them look bad. If I may, please let me be the first to say that taxes are
        not intuitive and you can't just wing them or think it's something you might
        get perfectly right going it alone. This is doubly the case now that the tax
        laws are changing. Don't avoid dealing with them, like I did. Next up for
        me regarding this podcast will be refining delivery and process. It's fun
        to learn on the way.

        Building Pride and Love, Teeth, Thanks.  Recorded on the office floor of the
        Internet Archive, I went for a grab bag of random thoughts, so this episode
        is very, very loose. I also didn''t have my pop shield out here, so apologies
        to your speakers. I mention the Patreon stupid and also offer PODCAST.TEXTFILES.COM
        as the secure central information and donation vector for this podcast going
        forward. It has been quite the ride watching support drop and return for this
        Patreon, and I don''t need more uncertainty in my life, thanks.  Opinion seems
        to float that people would like an interview show or similar, but I''d probably
        make it a bonus, because it would be different than this format, and notably
        longer. We''ll see when that happens, but it''s on my mind. Next episodes
        will be much less miscellaneous, but it felt great to talk about it all. Thanks
        for riding along.'

        longer than usual. I''ve talked about presentations and why I think they''re
        important here and there, but I try to lay it all down here, give you some
        pointers and thoughts, and hopefully inspire you to make your own. And I give
        an offer at the end. I''m always experimenting, so the podcast is not nailed
        down into a specific processed style that would come from a team working on
        it - so this episode is very dynamic and energetic. Learning my limits and
        what works and doesn''t is always important, as well as your feedback.'

        A pleasant enough essay about the nature of piles of \"stuff\" I get offered
        or that fall into my lap. Why does this happen? What are my thoughts on it?
        Here's a good starting overview of this aspect of history. I will say that
        the Great Patreon Stumble of 2017 has encouraged me to decentralize this podcast
        and contributions, which I bet will be good for me in the long run - so there's
        a silver lining. More than a few people are asking me to consider adding interview
        episodes to this podcast. I'd honestly like to ask you all what you think
        of that. I assume it'd be me and someone interesting talking for an hour,
        and then turning that into something smooth. It sure wouldn't be 20 minutes,
        and I am of the opinion it's basically another whole type of show. Maybe a
        bonus scattered here and there? I just don't see how it fits in the format
        and folks who like the sub-30-minutes running time will find themselves really
        behind. Well, let me know.  \_ \_"

        Better, The Best Life, Debt Unchained. \_   Like, I bet, most everyone out
        there, not every part of my life has been 100% great. I decided to just pack
        all that negativity (especially teenage years) into one episode so we can
        move on to more fun stories. This was definitely a hard episode to record
        and a harder one to shape into a cohesive whole. I'm glad I did it, but I
        look forward to more about beeps, boops and laughter.  This podcast is supported
