      name: The Lost Art Of Productive Debate
      author: Techdirt
      content: Even those of us who believe that the internet is overall a tremendous
        positive force when it comes to discourse and culture can admit that, in many
        parts of the online world, having constructive and substantive conversations
        is... difficult. And that issue has most certainly come to the fore in the
        last couple of years. So this week, we're joined by author Barry Eisler (one
        of our first and most frequent podcast guests) to tackle the challenge of
        framing important debates in productive ways, and actually getting somewhere
        with them.

      name: Can A Trivia App Resurrect Appointment Viewing?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Normally, we wouldn't dedicate a whole episode of the podcast to talking
        about a single app \u2014 but every now and then something small comes along
        that contains innovations worth exploring. So this week, we're taking a look
        at the hit trivia app HQ, which is one of the first new things in recent memory
        to gain real momentum with \"appointment viewing\"."

      name: Games That Tell Stories
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Gaming is changing the nature of storytelling. Video games of course
        \u2014 but also the modern rise of board games, tabletop RPGs and other forms
        of analog gaming. A good game does more than just arbitrarily pair play with
        a veneer of narrative, it marries the mechanics and the ideas to enable interesting
        new ways of conveying and exploring complex ideas. This week, we're joined
        by game designer Randy Lubin to discuss how games can tell stories in a way
        nothing else can."
