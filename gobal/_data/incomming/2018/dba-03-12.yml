      name: Facebook Won't Save Democracy
      author: Techdirt
      content: In the midst of the political chaos in America and the world at large,
        a whole lot of attention has been turned to Facebook and its role in modern
        democracy. The social network has responded by announcing another round of
        news feed changes, the true impact of which (if any) remains far from clear.
        This week, we're joined by Mathew Ingram from the Columbia Journalism Review
        to talk about Facebook's changes, and whether we can or should expect them
        to fix anything.

      author: Techdirt
      content: "When a tech company is huge and dominant, it can feel like competing
        with them is impossible. Worse still, it can sometimes feel like innovating
        is impossible, since they might just step in and take over as soon as someone
        executes on a good idea. Once upon a time this was how startups felt about
        Microsoft, while today it's more likely to be Google or Facebook. But no company,
        no matter how mighty, is immune to being disrupted \u2014 and figuring out
        how is the subject of this week's episode."

      content: 'A couple of weeks ago, Mike was in Washington, DC for the State Of
        The Net conference, where he participated in a panel called Internet Speech:
        Truth, Trust, Transparency & Tribalism. For this week''s podcast, we''ve got
        the audio from that conversation with all sorts of interesting ideas about
        how people are dealing with fake news, trolls, propaganda and more.'

      content: "Last week, Mike sparked lots of conversation with his post about rethinking
        the marketplace of ideas without losing sight of the importance of the fundamental
        principles of free speech. Naturally, there's plenty more to discuss on that
        topic, so this week we're joined by Buzzfeed general counsel Nabiha Syed \u2014
        whose recent article in the Yale Law Journal, Real Talk About Fake News, offered
        a thorough and insightful look at free speech online \u2014 to try to cut
        through all the simplistic takes on free speech and talk about where things
        are going.\r\n\r\nMike's post: https://tdrt.io/gCy\r\nNabiha's article: https://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/real-talk-about-fake-news"

      author: Techdirt
      content: 'When it comes to many of the legislative issues of interest to us
        here at Techdirt, we''ve always been able to count on at least one voice of
        reason amidst the congressional chaos: Representative Zoe Lofgren from California.
        In addition to playing a critical role in the fight against SOPA, she continues
        to be a voice of reason against bad copyright policy, expansive government
        surveillance, and the broken CFAA, among many other things. This week, she
        joins Mike on the podcast for a wide-ranging discussion about these topics
        and more.'

      name: Barbies v. Bratz
      author: Techdirt
      content: "If you've been reading Techdirt for more than five years, you probably
        remember the conclusion of Mattel v. MGA \u2014 and if you've been reading
        for more than thirteen years, you might even remember when it started. This
        epic legal battle over intellectual property went through nearly a decade
        of rulings and reversals, and the resulting story is a fascinating one that
        ties in a lot of the topics we discuss here at Techdirt. It's also the subject
        of the new book You Don't Own Me by law professor Orly Lobel, who joins us
        on this week's episode to revisit this particular law opera and what it says
        about the wider world of IP."

      content: "In 2016, mostly out of frustration, I wrote a post about how traffic
        is fake, audience numbers are garbage, and nobody knows how many people see
        anything. My feelings haven't changed much, and neither has the digital advertising
        ecosystem. And since regular podcast co-host Dennis Yang runs a digital metrics
        company, it only made sense for us to hash it out on an episode all about
        audience measurement and how it shapes online advertising.\r\n\r\n2016 Post:
