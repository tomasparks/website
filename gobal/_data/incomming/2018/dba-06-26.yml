        they said, and that this was your \"new favourite episode\", too. You cried
        out loud for more after we've released ep#194: Elephat. So we've returned
        to the turntables and will hit you directly in your face again! Harder than
        ever before! So enjoy a new mix of pure dubstep awesomeness coming out directly
        from the sound laboratory of the BitFellas bad boys.\r\nThanks to the Monstercat
        free music catalogue for making this mix elephatastic!\r\nBitFellas - The
        bass belongs to us this night!\r\n\r\nMixed by Vincenzo, compiled by Bobic,

      name: Are Tech And Journalism Att Odds With Each Other?
      author: Techdirt
      content: Between Elon Musk's proposal for a website ranking the credibility
        of journalists and Tim Draper blaming the collapse of Theranos on the press
        (not to mention Peter Thiel's attack on Gawker), it feels like there's a war
        brewing between Silicon Valley and journalism. Though the press has some major
        problems, it really seems like tech entrepreneurs are misunderstanding how
        it works and proposing some dangerous ideas. This week, we discuss the tensions
        between tech and journalism, and what will come from the proposals to address
        it.

      content: "Rosanne Siino has been on my list to talk to from day one of this
        podcast. As you know, I started by reaching out to Netscape folks and Rosanne
        was the head of communications for that very first dotcom company. She saw
        it all, she can give us her take on both the engineering side and the management
        side, since she was uniquely able to observe both. Rosanne and I were recently
        on a documentary series currently airing on A&amp;E in the US, The Untold
        Story of the 90s. So, I reached out, and we recoded this fantastic extended
        interview about all things Netscape and about the very birth of the Internet
        Era.&nbsp;\r\n      "
