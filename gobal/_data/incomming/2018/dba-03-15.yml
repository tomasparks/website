      name: How MoviePass Makes Money
      author: Techdirt
      content: "The apparent success of MoviePass raises a whole bunch of interesting
        business model questions \u2014 and privacy concerns about the data-harvesting
        portion of that business model add another layer of complexity. So this week,
        we're going back to a good old-fashioned formula for the podcast, and dedicating
        an episode to examining the company in detail and trying to figure out where
        it might be headed."

      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: "Don Melton is popularly known as the father of the Safari web browser
        or WebKit. He\u2019s basically a web browser legend. Not only does Don tell
        us a lot of great stuff about Safari, WebKit, Apple and more, but he was also
        an early Netscape employee, so we get some more great details about that company,
        especially in its later stages."
