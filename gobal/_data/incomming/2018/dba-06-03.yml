      name: The Link Between Credit And Surveillance
      author: Techdirt
      content: Both surveillance and the digitization of money are heavily-discussed
        topics, but the intersection between the two often goes overlooked. Historically,
        credit agencies have been trailblazers in the world of surveillance, and today
        we face the fact that the government can use payment providers and other financial
        tools as a means of enforcing its wishes. On this week's episode, we're joined
        by lawyer and writer Sarah Jeong, who recently wrote a four-part series on
        the subject, to discuss the past and future of credit, money, surveillance
        and the way they work together.

      name: Why Is Tesla So Successful?
      author: Techdirt
      content: 'Consumers looking for an electric car have several options to consider,
        but the buzz and excitement around Tesla continues to dwarf everything else.
        It''s hardly unfounded, but the scale of the company''s success is staggering,
        and there''s no single reason for it. This week, we discuss that simple question:
        just why is Tesla so successful?'

      name: Tech Policy Goes Local
      author: Techdirt
      content: "The conversation around tech policy has traditionally happened at
        the federal level, but more recently we've seen a change in that trend, and
        some of the most interesting experiments \u2014 both good and bad \u2014 have
        started happening in state and municipal arenas. This week, we're joined by
        Tech:NYC Executive Director Julie Samuels to discuss why this is happening
        and what it means."

      name: What Happened At The Oracle Google Trial?
      author: Techdirt
      content: Over the past few weeks, a jury heard the second round of the copyright
        fight between Oracle and Google over whether Google's use of the Java APIs
        in Android constituted copyright infringement, or whether it was fair use.  In
        the end, the jury went with fair use.  Reporter Sarah Jeong watched the entire
        trial from the courtroom and joins us on the Techdirt podcast this week to
        discuss both the legal details and the various oddities of this particular
        trial.

        is still booming. But it also still struggles under the weight of exclusive
        deals and content silos, and it feels like there's still plenty of innovation
