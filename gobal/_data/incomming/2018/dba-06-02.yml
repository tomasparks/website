      author: Techdirt
      content: "Silicon Valley has produced lots of disruptive technologies \u2014
        ways to solve problems by upending entrenched industries and, often enough,
        routing around protectionist regulations. But not all regulations are meaningless,
        not all industries are easy to disrupt, and sometimes \"fake it until you
        make it\" becomes plain old lying. This week, we discuss what happens when
        \"disruption\" goes wrong."

      name: Senator Wyden On The Expansion Of FBI Surveillance
      author: Techdirt
      content: It should surprise nobody that the FBI is seeking even broader digital
        surveillance powers by changing the warrant requirements and expanding the
        power of national security letters. If you're a regular Techdirt reader, it
        also won't surprise you to learn that Senator Ron Wyden is working hard to
        hold the line against this kind of expansion. This week, we're joined by Senator
        Wyden to discuss what the FBI is up to and what the public needs to know about
        it.

      author: Techdirt
      content: "Chatbots have been around for a very long time in some form or another,
        but now they appear to be making a comeback \u2014 or at least attempting
        one. This week, Mike and regular co-host Dennis (who is working on a chatbot
        startup) are joined by special guest Veronica Belmont to discuss the potential
        of chatbots and just how much skepticism is warranted."

      author: Techdirt
      content: "Pok\xE9mon Go is an undeniable phenomenon, and the first mass-appeal
        hit from the world of augmented reality \u2014 a technology people have been
        expecting would transform gaming for years. That leaves a big question, though:
        is its popularity a sign of the future for AR, or is the game an isolated
        phenomenon that owes more to the popularity of its brand? This week, we discuss
        what we can learn from Pok\xE9mon Go, and whether we can truly learn anything
        at all."

      author: Techdirt
      content: Net neutrality has a long and complicated history, and despite some
        recent victories, that story is far from over. This week, Mike is joined by
        resident broadband expert Karl Bode to discuss what's next for net neutrality,
        and what we need to do to fight for it.

      name: Is Your Algorithm Racist?
      author: Techdirt
      content: Algorithms have become a powerful force in the world, but for all the
        impressive good they do, they sometimes show some worrying tendencies. Algorithms
        that discriminate are a problem that nobody's found a solution for yet. This
        week, we discuss why some algorithms appear to be racist, and whether there's
        anything that can be done about it.

      name: Can Direct Democracy Work?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Technology has made \"direct democracy\" \u2014 letting citizens vote
        on specific, granular issues instead of just electing representatives \u2014
        more viable than ever, but does that mean it's a good idea? This week, we
        discuss the ins and outs of direct democracy, including a special addendum
        on the surprising results of the Brexit referendum."
