      content: "Eliot Peper is a novelist who uses thorough research and creative
        thinking to produce science fiction that can feel more like eerily-accurate
        prognostication. Exploring possible futures with real insight has always been
        one of sci-fi's greatest strengths, and this week Peper joins Mike on the
        podcast to discuss his work, methods, and ideas about tomorrow.\r\n\r\nEliot
