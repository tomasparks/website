      author: Techdirt
      content: "Law isn't simple, and truly learning about it takes more than a few
        short primers or even an in-depth guide or two \u2014 which makes it the perfect
        topic to explore via the medium of podcasts. This week, we've got a pair of
        guests who are doing exactly that: Ken White of Popehat fame, who recently
        launched the Make No Law podcast about First Amendment issues, and Elizabeth
        Joh, co-host of the What Trump Can Teach Us About Constitutional Law podcast.
        Instead of picking their brains about the law itself, we've got an episode
        all about their experience using podcasts to teach people about legal issues."

      content: "People have been yelling at me for years that I\u2019ve not covered
        more technical aspects of the web\u2019s history, especially things like Java.
        Specifically Java. The argument can be made that Java helped the web evolve
        into what it\u2019s become. So, that\u2019s why I was thrilled to sit down
        with Todd Sundsted, who is a developer who has been working with Java for
        more than 20 years. Todd walks us through the history of Java and why it is
        so important to the web\u2019s general evolution."

        This time, on clevercast, I reminisce about one of my earliest personal websites. What happened to its content? How did I create it? Is there any chance of restoring it back to greatness?
