      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: "Summary:\r\nRobert Reid, the founder of Rhapsody, can be considered
        the Godfather (founding father?) of the streaming music reality we now live
        in.\_But guess what? That's only half of this episode! Because it turns out,
        Robert is the author of a book that was probably one of the biggest reasons
        I started doing this podcast. The book was Architects of the Web, 1000 Days
        that Built the Future of Business. It was one of the first books to come out
        about the history of the web era. It was published in 1997, "
