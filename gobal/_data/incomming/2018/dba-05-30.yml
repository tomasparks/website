      name: Where Do You Get Your News?
      author: Techdirt
      content: The news industry has been in an ongoing state of upheaval ever since
        the dawn of the internet. In addition to the many ways that technology changes
        reporting and publishing, there has also been a profound effect on how people
        find their news. This week, we step away from the big debate about echo chambers
        and filter bubbles, and talk about evolving news-finding habits and what they
        mean for the industry.

      name: Can We Really Colonize Mars?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Elon Musk got plenty of attention recently for announcing his plans
        to colonize Mars. But that's not exactly a new idea \u2014 so we wondered
        if it was really a different, exciting and realistic plan, or just a reiteration
        of the standard far-flung dream. To answer that question, we brought in three
        experts: Amy Shira Teitel (a space and flight historian and creator of YouTube's
        Vintage Space videos), JPL's Fred Calef (a Mars geologist and \"keeper of
        the maps\" for Mars rovers), and the New Space Intiative's Tanya Harrison
        (who worked on Curiosity and several other Mars missions). The result was
        a fascinating discussion about Mars and whether or not we're actually headed
        there any time soon."

      author: Techdirt
      content: Last year, we got a lot of positive feedback on our episode taking
        a look at the Consumer Electronics Show with the help of journalist Rob Pegoraro.
        So this year, we've brought Rob back for another look at the highs and lows
        of CES.

      name: The Pros And Cons Of Pros And Cons
      author: Techdirt
      content: On the surface, the idea of "pro and con" debates seems like a good
        way to ensure an issue is fully explored. But is it truly a productive approach?
        This week, we debate the nature of debates and possible alternatives to the
        adversarial approach.

      name: Is The Internet Of Things The Future, A Total Mess, Or Both?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "The internet of things has been taking plenty of flack ever since
        the first time someone floated the idea of a connected fridge or some-such
        in the 90s \u2014 but despite the knee-jerk instinct to scoff at some things,
        the truth is there are all sorts of interesting possibilities emerging from
        all these \"pointless\" connected devices. Of course, there are also some
        serious security concerns... This week, we discuss IoT and what the ever-increasing
        presence of such devices means for the future."

      name: Changing Government Starts With You
      author: Techdirt
      content: For obvious reasons, politics and government are on just about everyone's
        mind at the moment, prompting a vast range of reactions and opinions. A lot
        of people who share a desire for change are divided not only by what form
        they think that change should take, but by what methods they think should
        be employed to achieve it. Former Senate staffer and long-time Techdirt friend
        Jennifer Hoelzer recently wrote a column entitled Your Government Won't Change...
        Unless You Do and this week she joins us on the podcast to delve further into
        this idea and what it means for optimists, cynics, pragmatists and everyone
        else.

      name: The New FCC
      author: Techdirt
      content: Net neutrality is at risk. The FCC under Ajit Pai is clearly intent
        on destroying it, and this is quickly turning into a fight for the future
        of the internet. This week, we're joined by Gigi Sohn, one of former chairman
        Tom Wheeler top advisors at the FCC and now a fellow at the Open Society Foundation,
        to discuss what's happening at the FCC and what needs to be done in response.

      name: Autonomous Cars Are Accelerating
      author: Techdirt
      content: The adoption of self-driving cars is rapidly changing from science
        fiction to present reality. We had a preliminary discussion on the subject
        here on the podcast a couple years ago, but today we're digging more deeply
        the impact this is having, especially on policy. R Street Institute senior
        fellow Ian Adams joins us as a special guest this week for a discussion about
        the many implications of this accelerating technological shift.

      content: "After years of working on the go, Mike has the mobile office down
        to a science \u2014 and wherever he sets it up, nearby gadget geeks have plenty
        of questions and comments. So this week we're joined by Espree Devora, host
        of the podcasts Women In Tech and We Are L.A. Tech, for a fun discussion about
        today's high-tech offices-in-bags."
