      name: Overreacting To Facebook's Mistakes Won't Solve Anything
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Facebook. Cambridge Analytica. Need I say more? There's plenty to
        discuss. Among them is the question of similarities between what happened
        and the Obama campaign \u2014 which is why we're lucky to be joined this week
        by Catherine Bracy, who led the Obama campaign's San Francisco tech office,
        and worked on its Facebook app, for a discussion about what really went down
        with Cambridge Analytica, and all the misinformation that's out there."
