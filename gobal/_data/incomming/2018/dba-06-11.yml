        the web. Karl Mattson helped launched one of the first political news websites,
        ElectionLine. He helped cover the 1996 election when covering an election
        on the web was a completely new thing. He then moved to AOL, helped run their
        news channels and has some amazing historical details about he era, especially
        the Clinton intern scandal.\r\n      "
