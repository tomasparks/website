      content: 'The Firing Episode: That Time I Got Fired, A Sysadmin''s Life, If
        You Lose Jason You Lose Us, A Steaming Cup of Coffee, The Unnamed Worst Customer
        Ever, Goodbye, Hello Internet Archive. An episode about the only time I''ve
        been fired so far! Not bad for roughly 20 years of working life. I am pretty
        sure I got most of the details right, but you never know. I say this compared
        to most of the talking about history I do because it seems to be that when
        a person describes an emotionally traumatic event, they tend to get details
        real weird - it must be how the brain copes. Subscribe and support this podcast
