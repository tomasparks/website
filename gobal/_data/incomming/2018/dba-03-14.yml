      name: 143. Neil Hunt on the History of Netflix and Netflix Streaming
      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: Neil Hunt is the Chief Product Officer at Netflix. Since he's been
        at Netflix since 1999, not only is he the perfect person to tell us how Netflix
        streaming came about (the technical hurdles, the strategic decisions, etc.)
        but he can also give us the whole history of Netflix, from basically the very
        beginning.
