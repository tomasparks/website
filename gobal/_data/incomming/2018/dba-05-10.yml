      author: Ben Gilbert & David Rosenthal
      content: "Acquired wraps up a big few weeks of coverage with not an IPO or an
        M&A or a fundraising round, but what\u2019s still the largest tech exit in
        recent memory: Spotify\u2019s $30B direct public listing. We dive into what
        it all means and how we got here: from Napster to iTunes to Facebook (and
        even some Justin Timberlake thrown in for good measure). Acquired FM is on
        the scene and spinning all the hits from this new wave music industry titan!"

      author: Ben Gilbert & David Rosenthal
      content: "Acquired is live on the scene following Dropbox\u2019s public market
        debut. From playing a central role in the early days of Y Combinator, to having
        Steve Jobs famously label the company a \u201Cfeature not a product\u201D,
        to pivoting from consumers to enterprise to developers and back again, the
        silicon valley history runs deep with this one. What twists and turns lie
        ahead for Dropbox as a public company? We speculate!"
