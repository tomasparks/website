        Negativland Sleepover, Don''s New Hangout, Goodbye Don, Moving the Archives,

        Joyce, who spent over 30 years making a radio masterpiece. When I do my livestreams,
        I tend to put selections from this archive as the soundtrack, and there''s
        always a few new fans born of it. The Over the Edge archives are at https://archive.org/details/ote
        - over 1,500 hours are up there.'

      name: 186. TheGlobe.com Story with Stephan Paternot
      author: Brian McCullough @brianmcc
      content: "I said in the book, I think TheGlobe.com was the quintessential dot-com
        company. We spoke to one of the cofounders previously, Todd Krizelman. Todd
        was great, but he was time constrained and he didn\u2019t quite get as personal
        about the story as I would have hoped. Well, I finally got to talk to the
        other founder of TheGlobe, Stephan Paternot. And Stephan was\u2026 AMAZING.
        He shared the whole story, the whole wild ride, from a historical angle, from
        a business angle, from an entrepreneurial angle and also, from a very personal
        angle. THIS the dot-com era story I\u2019ve been looking for for years. It\u2019s
        also the story of probably the most important pioneer of social media before
        there was even a term for such a thing. And by the way\u2026 that TV Show
        that just came out on NAT GEO, Valley of the Boom? THIS IS THAT STORY. Stephan
        just re-released his book, A Very Public Offering: The Story of theglobe.com
        and the First Internet Revolution."
