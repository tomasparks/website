      name: How One Court Just Screwed Up Software Development
      author: Techdirt
      content: "We've already written about the insanity of the appeals court overturning
        Google's fair use victory against Oracle \u2014 but there's plenty to dig
        into regarding just how bad the ruling is. This week, we're joined by Pamela
        Samuelson, a law professor and co-director of the Center for Law & Technology
        at Berkeley, to discuss what the court just did to the world of software development."

      name: Is The Economy More Important Than Democracy?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "The economy is important \u2014 very important. But is that because
        it matters in and of itself, or because it's the engine for achieving the
        things we really do care about? Here at Techdirt we've always been strong
        advocates of the free market, but we've never been absolutists about things
        like regulation, and we believe it's very important to explore these issues
        in detail. This week on the podcast we're joined by James Allworth, co-host
        of the Exponent podcast and author of a recent post entitled Prioritizing
        Economics is Crippling the U.S. Economy, to discuss entrepreneurship, democracy,
        the economy and more.\r\n\r\nRead the article: https://medium.com/@jamesallworth/the-slow-decay-of-americas-entrepreneurial-society-f9aeb6145891"
