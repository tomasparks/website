      name: Why Are There So Many Messaging Companies?
      author: Techdirt
      content: 'If you want to send someone a message online today, you''ve got a
        hell of a lot of options. Far from the erstwhile IM dominance of ICQ, today
        there are messaging platforms of every shape and size, a blurring of the lines
        between messaging and social media, and messaging components incorporated
        into almost everything. This week, we ask a simple question: why so many,
        and what are they all for?'

      author: Techdirt
      content: 'Recently, some Facebook staffers raised an interesting question: should
        the social media giant employ its significant power to stem the rise of Donald
        Trump? This week, we discuss that notion and the broader question: should
        the internet companies that influence so many aspects of our communication
        and information gathering pursue political goals?'

      name: Hacking The Patent System
      author: Techdirt
      content: "We all know the patent system is riddled with problems, and badly
        in need of reform. But reform comes slow \u2014 really, really slow. So some
        tech companies have been doing what they do best: innovate. They are finding
        ways to get around the biggest problems of the patent system without waiting
        on go-nowhere legislative reform efforts. This week we're joined by Julie
        Samuels, President of the Board at Engine, to discuss the innovation-based
        approach to navigating the patent system and changing patent culture."

      name: Is There Enough Demand For The On Demand Economy?
      author: Techdirt
      content: The "gig economy" of on-demand peer-to-peer services like Uber has
        been gaining traction, but not every company is faring so well. In some areas,
        the rush of entrants has outstripped demand and left on-demand providers struggling
        to stay afloat. This week we discuss what happens when there's not enough
        demand for an on-demand platform, and what it might mean for the sector as
        a whole.

      author: Techdirt
      content: "The battle for net neutrality seemed like it was over \u2014 but the
        regulations left a loophole open. Unsurprisingly, ISPs quickly started exploiting
        it, offering \"zero rating\" services to do an end-run around true net neutrality.
        Last week's guest Marvin Ammori joins us again this week, to discuss the true
        and imperfect state of net neutrality, and the many games internet providers
        play."

      name: Is It Futile To Draw Borders On The Internet?
      author: Techdirt
      content: "In a world defined by borders for thousands of years, the global nature
        of the internet has caused all sorts of confusion and absurdity. Geographically
        restricted content, fuzzily defined jurisdictions, libel tourism \u2014 these
        are all symptoms of a border-filled world coming to terms with a borderless
        network. Since attempts to carve up the internet along geographical lines
        aren't likely to stop anytime soon, this week we ask the question: are such
        attempts futile, and could online borders really serve any purpose to begin
        with?"

      name: Apple, The FBI & You
      author: Techdirt
      content: I don't think I need to reiterate how important the battle over the
        future of encryption is. It's not new, but rather the latest clash in a fight
        that has been raging for years, and the high-profile example of the San Bernardino
        attacker's iPhone has cast a spotlight on it. This week, we're joined by longtime
        Techdirt friend Marvin Ammori to dig into the details of this issue, its potential
        consequences, and its context in the history of encryption.

      name: The Tough Choices Platforms Make
      author: Techdirt
      content: Back in March, Mike moderated a panel at RightsCon on the subject of
        intermediary liability and the delicate balancing act that platform providers
        have to play on that front, with lawyers from Meetup, Change.org, and Medium.
        This week, in lieu of a regular podcast episode we've got a recording of that
        discussion, which delves deeply into some of the difficult choices companies
        like this have to make.

      author: Techdirt
      content: "Anyone even remotely interested in free culture, the internet and
        copyright surely knows the name Aaron Swartz \u2014 but only some truly understand
        what made him tick, and why he was considered so special and important in
        that world. This week and next, we're joined by Justin Peters, author of The
        Idealist, a new book that takes a close look at Aaron himself as well as the
        internet culture that gave rise to his attitudes and activism, which is the
        focus of this first half of the discussion."

        with a closer look at Aaron himself.

      author: Techdirt
      content: "Anyone who reads Techdirt knows our opinion on encryption: stronger
        is better, and giving the government (or anyone else) a back door is a dangerous
        idea. We've decried a lot of the stupid arguments that we've heard in favor
        of back doors \u2014 usually coming from technologically clueless politicians
        and law enforcement officers \u2014 but that doesn't mean we aren't open to
        considering some smart ones. This week, we've invited Albert Wenger (who you
        may recall from a discussion about basic income way back in Episode 16) to
        share his pro-backdoor position and engage in some friendly debate."
