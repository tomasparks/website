      name: These Scammers Picked The Wrong Guy
      author: Techdirt
      content: "If you're a fan of the Reply All podcast, then you're probably still
        processing the story they told in a recent two-part episode about the insane
        lengths that host Alex Goldman went to track down a phone scammer. If you
        haven't heard the story, and you think you've seen all there is to see on
        the \"messing with scammers\" front... well, you're in for a surprise. We
        strongly suggest you listen to the Reply All story first \u2014 then listen
        to our conversation with Alex about the whole saga on this week's episode
        of the Techdirt Podcast.\r\n\r\nReply All Episode 102, \"Long Distance\" -

      name: 20 Years Of Techdirt
      author: Techdirt
      content: Can you believe it? Tomorrow is our 20th anniversary! Techdirt has
        come a long way since Mike started it as a newsletter on August 23rd, 1997,
        and this week's episode of the podcast is a celebration and exploration of
        that history. Mike and Dennis are joined by Medium's Alex Feerst acting as
        moderator/interviewer to discuss the past 20 years of Techdirt.

      name: The Problems With SESTA And Why Section 230 Matters
      author: Techdirt
      content: "Recently, we've been writing about SESTA, Congress' latest attack
        on Section 230 of the CDA, and helping to organize a campaign against it.
        But there's still a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation out there regarding
        the bill, so this week we're joined by Daphne Keller from Stanford's Center
        For Internet And Society and Emma Llans\xF3 from the Center for Democracy
        and Technology to dig deeper into the problems with the bill and why protecting
        Section 230 is vital."
