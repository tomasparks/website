      content: "Acquired returns with a classic, delving into Microsoft\u2019s first
        acquisition ever: Forethought Inc, the makers of PowerPoint. Hate it or love
        it, you can\u2019t deny the combined companies\u2019 impact: by the early
        90\u2019s PowerPoint had transformed the way businesses, educators and governments
        communicate, ensuring job security for pointy-haired Dilbert bosses everywhere."

      content: "The US has been something of a surveillance state since long before
        the Snowden revelations that showed the full extent of some of the NSA's activities.
        A lot of this is made possible \u2014 often unintentionally \u2014 by decades-old
        court decisions regarding technology. It's a problem. This week, reporter
        Cyrus Farivar \u2014 whose new book Habeas Data digs into this judicial history
        \u2014 joins us to discuss how courts created the surveillance state.\r\n\r\nHabeas
