I am writing a Hard science fiction book,
I am trying to ground truth my story

the world is based on Seaquest DSV (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SeaQuest_DSV ), on a ocean planet (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_planet)

the Internet and communication network use 
Probabilistic Routing Protocol for Intermittently Connected Networks

Ship/Colony to Ship/Colony is build-upon Self-Organized Time Division Multiple Access (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Organized_Time_Division_Multiple_Access )

the communication device have smart antennas ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_antenna ) and smart acoustic modem (based on smart antennas ideas)

I am looking for a network that is not based ip address method, but mac address based
