I had just left town when I heard thought the grapvine that these was inseted in [kindles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-reader),
I had been showing my [eReader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Reader) for about a year before hand
so I started to looking into hacking/modding a kindle

* [eink device to prove the usability in a dtn](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=207545)
* [mutt e-mail client on the kindle](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=149532)

for email:
mutt[1] could be used with maildir[2]
see Configuring Mutt from [3]

For Web access:
a lot of the current system like TEK[4], freenet[5] use proxy servers witch are too memory hungry for e-ink devices

the offline browsing[6] method makes sense,
but when a url has not been mirrored the browser trys to connect to the internet and fails
I have not seen a TEK, Freenet interface that is not proxy server based
