I have been developing a toolchain that can convert a minecraft [schematic](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Schematic_file_format) file to X3D

tools:
* [blockmodel](https://github.com/paulharter/blockmodel)
* [InstantReality aopt tool](http://www.instantreality.org/downloads/)
* missing a lightmap [generator](^1)

example [https://tomasparks.github.io/temp/minecraft2x3d/test_x3d.html](https://tomasparks.github.io/temp/minecraft2x3d/test_x3d.html)

bugs:
camera not set (click: Show everything)
texture seams
missing transparency
missing sky


[^1] looking at using blender, but I have not found a automated way of doing lightmapping :(
