[dtn-interest] Proxy server for files

Tom Sparks <tom_a_sparks@yahoo.com.au> Thu, 26 January 2012 09:30 UTCShow header

I am wondering if there is a proxy server for files?
I have a samba server with tv shows and movies witch I watch through a media center
I have been asked indirectly "can we access the files?" by friends
Dtn/seakernet is my only option for them to access the files
But because i have 1TB of data and growing, i want my friends to subscribe to the tv shows they want like a podcast

Over and above the clearly illegal activity you are describing, I'm not
sure DTN would be the best method for achieving your aims.

Off-topic, but that's astoundingly definitive given that it seems nearly
impossible for you to have access to all the relevant facts.

Separating copyright issues from what is an interesting technical
question:

Why do you say that?  It seems like there's a vast amount of data, it's
needed in multiple places, the need for data is quite tolerant to delay,
and moving disks (or having laptops with people, or having a few G spare
in phones that have wifi, etc.) around is quite feasible.  This seems to
be entirely within DTN's design aim.

I have on occasion taken most of a GB of map data to other people to
load onto their machines, managed manually (to avoid waiting for loading
on 1 Mb/s DSL), but had their been some DTN-type way to do this it might
have been better.  The situation isn't so different from Tom's (except
that I don't watch TV :-), and I'm using OSM data licensed under
cc-by-sa (which may or may not be copyrightable in the first place)).

To me this once again points out that there don't seem to be any
application-level programs that use DTN -- I have yet to see an
announcement of a chat program or MTA that runs over BP, or a
distributed filesystem.  Certainly a DTN podcast distribution mechanism
would be useful for communities with sporadic local connectivity and
poor long-haul internet connections.

I have a ADSL connection, my friend's have 3G mobile internet (1Gb plan), so this is the reasoning

Podcast distribution was poor description of what was think of
A mailing list/usenet system fits the idea better
Based on the alt.binary usenet, the video are compressed and split up into 20Mb rar files, par2 file are used for forward error correction

Ps: I could see DTN communities developing a tv program like SeattleWireless TV
