*  I rediscovered [Minecraft artwork that had been 3D printed](https://www.flickr.com/groups/mineways/pool/)
*  I want to create some minecraft artwork without buying/using the minecraft game[^1]:
*  I want to have offer [virtual tours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_tour) of the models

## Virtual tour options ##

* ObjectVR
* Panoramas
* walkthough

I could have used [three.js](http://www.threejs.org)
