Always wanted to build your own [Altair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800) but missed out during the 70′s? Well, now you can with the Altair 8800micro kit. It is a reduced size replica of the famous machine that inspired [Bill Gates to start Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC). Program the emulated 8080 processor right from the front panel or run programs from a SDHC memory card!

Can’t solder, no problem. We offer a fully assembled and tested version for those who want to get started right away.

The new 88-DSK RAM Drive gives your Altair 8800micro the capability to run [CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M) in a virtual disk drive setting. The board contains 2 512K RAM drives that are battery backed. You can now load disk images stored on the SD card into the RAM drives and run CP/M software right on the Altair micro.
