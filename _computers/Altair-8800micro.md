Always wanted to build your own Altair but missed out during the 70′s? Well, now you can with the Altair 8800micro kit. It is a reduced size replica of the famous machine that inspired Bill Gates to start Microsoft. Program the emulated 8080 processor right from the front panel or run programs from a SDHC memory card!
Can’t solder, no problem. We offer a fully assembled and tested version for those who want to get started right away.

The new 88-DSK RAM Drive gives your Altair 8800micro the capability to run CP/M in a virtual disk drive setting. The board contains 2 512K RAM drives that are battery backed. You can now load disk images stored on the SD card into the RAM drives and run CP/M software right on the Altair micro.
