# DNS (Name Systems)

## GADs

Currently GNU Alternative Domain System (GADs) \[GADs1\] \[GADs2\] is my favourite DNS system, but it has a few issue for a DTN network, the DHT system and .zkey system

-   the Distributed hash table (dht) system can be changed to X-vine \[XVINE\] witch has a few issue for DTN network also
-   the .zkey system is not workable in a DTN network
