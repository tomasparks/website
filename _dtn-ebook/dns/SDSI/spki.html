SPKI/SDSI Certificates</h1>
<p><a href="../images/local-full.jpg"><img src="../images/local.jpg"></a>

<p>
SPKI, SDSI and the other certificate mechanisms from 1996 onward started out to address
apparent overcomplication in the X.509 world. However, by starting with a blank sheet of paper,
they ended up addressing a more basic problem than complexity.  Earlier certificate mechanisms
suffered from the Walton's Mountain Assumption - that if you know a name for someone you know
their identity (all their defining characteristics) - and that if you know someone's identity, then
you know whether they're authorized to do or have
something they request.  This assumption is true in a world of small towns where, as the old
joke goes, ``you don't have to use your turn signals because everyone knows where you're going''.  That world
no longer exists, so earlier certificate mechanisms based on it (X.509 in particular) fail miserably.
Specifically, the Walton's Mountain Assumption is that those characteristics of a small town apply to the entire world.
<p>
This assumption is replaced by one of local knowledge: that knowledge required for
security decisions and identity establishment remains local but the world extends beyond any one locality.  In SDSI,
an identifier is valid only locally to the
person who creates it but the underlying raw public key is valid globally. In SPKI, an authorization grant
is made only locally.  If you need to 
grant authorization to someone beyond your locality, then you may (must) delegate that grant through a
chain of local relationships.  The same applies to PolicyMaker, KeyNote and XrML V2 (when properly used).
<p>
Along the way, we have learned that what is important in certificate (and related) security systems
is not the computer-readable data structures and protocols alone. Rather, these certificates, licenses, grants, 
ACL entries, ..., are a cyberspace reflection of relationships in the physical world - and the security of
these systems rests most heavily on the security of the process by which the physical world relationships
are bound to their cyberspace reflections.
That security far outweighs the more trivial security of private key protection, key length, choice of algorithm,
etc., that people have obsessed about for decades.
In pursuing this line of reasoning, we now have
the <a href="#UPnP">Ceremony</a> work but this work is in its infancy.  There is much more to come.

<br>There are five certificate syntax forms referenced from this page:&nbsp;
SPKI/SDSI, X.509, PGP, X9.59 (AADS), PolicyMaker and KeyNote.&nbsp; This
page defines SPKI/SDSI and gives some links to the others but doesn't claim
to provide a full set.

There are frequent questions about the status of SPKI in IETF and in general.  I wrote to the cryptography list about this
in <a href="re-spki-1.txt">this message</a> and, as I often do, in <a href="re-spki-2.txt">a reply to that message</a>.

<a NAME="1-SPKI/SDSI"></a>SPKI/SDSI Documentation</h3>
The SPKI/SDSI certificate format is the product of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/spki-charter.html">the
SPKI Working Group</a> of the IETF.&nbsp; The IETF SPKI documentation is
in four parts:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2692.txt">RFC2692: Requirements</a>
giving the requirements gathered by the working group at the start of the
process.</li>

<li>
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2693.txt">RFC2693: Theory</a> giving
the theory of authorization certificates, as opposed to name or ID certificates
that most people (e.g., X.509) discuss. This document points out some of
the flawed assumptions in ID certificate theory and shows how SPKI's certificates
(both authorization and ID) attempt to correct those flaws.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://theworld.com/~cme/spki.txt">structure</a> #5 (old, #6
coming soon) -- giving the detailed structure of certificates that satisfy
the theory RFC.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://theworld.com/~cme/examples.txt">examples</a> #1 (even
older) -- giving actual examples of certificates, both for instruction
in how to use authorization certificates and for testing implementations
for interoperability.</li>

<h3>
<a NAME="dsig"></a>Digital Signature Risks</h3>
The idea that digital signatures could enable electronic commerce through
what has come to be known as <a href="http://theworld.com/~cme/html/spki.html#non-repudiation">non-repudiation</a>
was first proposed by Diffie and Hellman in their seminal paper, ``New
Directions in Cryptography''.&nbsp; The idea has since gained much popularity.
<p>It is generally asserted that one can achieve the desired non-repudiation
through the combination of strength of cryptography and security of <a href="http://theworld.com/~cme/html/spki.html#CAs">Certificate
Authorities</a>.&nbsp; However, as <a href="http://theworld.com/~cme/html/spki.html#Don Davis">Don
Davis</a> and others have pointed out, this puts a burden on the individual
keyholder that that person may not be equipped to handle.&nbsp; The result,
when this is applied to normal consumers with home computers, is a potential
victimization of that consumer.
<p>One of the problems here is the change in computer cost and therefore
ubiquity. In 1976, when Diffie and Hellman were writing and proposed non-repudiation
(under a different term), computers were in guarded glass rooms. Now they're
in the family room where the neighbor's teenage son has easy, unguarded
access. A guarded computer might well serve as a check writing machine,
but an unguarded one is too dangerous to empower that way.

Andy emphasizes that you don't get trust from technology.&nbsp; It takes
work.&nbsp; This suggests to me that we may need layers of middlemen not
for shipping or inventory reasons, but for trust reasons.&nbsp; The Internet
allows me go directly to the middleman's own suppliers, but I don't have
the energy or time (or money to lose in inevitable risk) to make so many
individual relationships.</li>

<p>&nbsp;
<p><i>[IMHO, we could use a law declaring that there is </i><b>non-authenticating
information</b><i> (namely anything anyone other than the person being
identified might be able to learn) and that any creditor using non-authenticating
information to establish a credit account is and remains liable for all
charges incurred under that account. BTW, such a law might cause all mailed
credit card offers to dry up -- a good side-effect. Also, it should be
noted that all information in a credit report is automatically non-authenticating
under this definition, so that controls on the dissemination of credit
reports would not be necessary to prevent identity theft (only to preserve
privacy).]</i>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i>[Don points out that if you naively sign something that isn't specifically
anchored to the transaction you intended, then that signed message can
be replayed in a transaction where you don't intend the result. He notes
that e-mail cryptography standards encourage this mistake. If you assume
non-repudiation of signed e-mail, this can have unfortunate results.]</i></ul>

<b>The CAP Theorem</b> states that you can design a distributed system
to achieve any two of the following three characteristics: (1) data Consistency;
(2) application Availability; (3) tolerance of network Partitions; but
you can never achieve all three at the same time. This has application
to revocation in certificate systems. The various revocation mechanisms
are attempts to achieve data consistency in an application that must be
available and must tolerate network partitions.</li>

X9.59 (also known as AADS) is a mechanism that uses ACLs only, instead
of certificates.&nbsp; Specifically, the ACL is a bank's account database
that has had a public-key field added, so that the bank can look up the
account-holder's public key.&nbsp; This makes the X9.59 ACL an authorization
instrument, in SPKI terms, similar to the ACL implemented by SSH's file:
.ssh/authorized_keys.&nbsp; For more information on X9.59, see: <a href="http://www.garlic.com/~lynn">http://www.garlic.com/~lynn</a></li>

<a NAME="Glossary"></a><b>Glossary</b></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<b>asymmetric cryptography</b>: defined originally by Diffie and Hellman,
a cryptographic system using different keys for encipherment and decipherment
such that one of the keys (private key) can not be derived efficiently
from the other (public key).</li>

<li>
<b>certificate</b>: a digitally signed data record communicating some information
from the signer (issuer) of the certificate to the verifier of the certificate.&nbsp;
A certificate differs from a general signed message usually in that:</li>

<ol>
<li>
the data structure is well defined so that a computer can interpret the
structure, and</li>

<li>
the certificate's ``message'' is of the form ``to whom it may concern'',
rather than addressed to a specific party</li>
</ol>

<li>
<a NAME="CAs"></a><b>Certificate Authority</b>: in the X.509 world, a special
certificate issuing entity, usually part of a hierarchy, responsible for
issuing all certificates to end entity keyholders.</li>

<li>
<b>digital signature</b>: a computation with a private key and typically
the hash of a document or data record such that any entity in possession
of the matching public key can verify computationally that the computation
was performed by the associated private key and that the signed document
has not changed since the signature was computed.</li>

<li>
<b>hash</b>: a cryptographic computation over a message yielding a fixed
length quantity (the hash value) such that it is computationally difficult
to find any two different input messages yielding the same hash value.&nbsp;
The ``strength of a hash'' is a reference to the difficulty of finding
such message pairs.</li>

<li>
<b>keyholder</b>: the holder of the private key.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="non-repudiation"></a><b><a href="../non-repudiation.htm">non-repudiation</a></b>:
the notion that the
keyholder is legally liable for any statement digitally signed by that
keyholder's signature key.</li>

<li>
<b>PGP</b>: Pretty Good Privacy -- an early public key application, defining
the first public key infrastructure to be widely deployed.</li>

<li>
<b>PKI</b>: Public Key Infrastructure -- a mechanism to permit the distributed
use of public keys, involving certificates that bind information of interest
to public keys</li>

<li>
<b>private key</b>: a key in an asymmetric cryptosystem that is kept secret
and held by one entity, called the keyholder.</li>

<li>
<b>public key</b>:&nbsp; a key in an asymmetric cryptosystem that need
not be kept secret and is often</li>

<li>
<b>SDSI</b>: Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure</li>

<li>
<b>secret key</b>: a key in a symmetric cryptosystem.</li>

<li>
<b>speaks for</b>: the notion that a private digital signature key speaks
digitally signed statements in cyberspace on behalf of the keyholder</li>

<li>
<b>SPKI</b>: Simple Public Key Infrastructure</li>

<li>
<b>symmetric cryptography</b>: the original kind of cryptography, in which
the same key is used for both encipherment and decipherment.</li>

<li>
<b><a href="../trust.htm">trust</a></b>: a term so frequently misused that it has become
almost devoid of meaning.  It means whatever you want it to mean, but vendors keep using it
because it evokes warm and fuzzy feelings and that helps sales.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Web of Trust"></a><b>Web of Trust: </b>a mechanism for <a href="http://theworld.com/~cme/html/web.html">fault
tolerance of certificate signature</a>, associated with PGP.</li>

<li>
<b>X.509</b>: a data structure defined as part of the X.500 global directory
effort, designed to bind an X.500 distinguished name to a public key.&nbsp;
The presumption in X.509 is that the named entity is the keyholder of the
associated public key.&nbsp; In some cases, it is assumed that the public
key speaks for the named entity.</li>
