<h1>SEXP---(S-expressions)</h1>
<br>

S-expressions are a data structure for representing complex data.
They are a variation on LISP S-expressions. (Lisp was invented by John
McCarthy).
<p>

We have adapted S-expressions for use in <a
href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis/sdsi.html">SDSI</a> and <a
href="http://world.std.com/~cme/html/spki.html">SPKI</a>.  The work
reported here is, however, application-independent.  (That is, we will
use S-expressions in the SPKI/SDSI work, but have developed it and
presented it in an application-independent manner, so that others may
most easily consider adopting it for other applications.)
<p>

SDSI has been developed by Professors 
<a href="index.html">Ronald L. Rivest</a>
and 
Butler Lampson of
MIT's
<a href="http://www.lcs.mit.edu">Laboratory for Computer Science</a>,
members of LCS's
<a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis">Cryptography and Information Security</a> research group.
<p>
SDSI research is supported by DARPA contract DABT63-96-C-0018, "Security
for Distributed Computer Systems".
<p>
SPKI has been developed by 
<a href="http://www.clark.net/pub/cme/home.html">Carl Ellison</a> and others
in the IETF SPKI working group.<p>
We are currently merging the designs to form SPKI/SDSI 2.0.  This design will
use S-expressions as the basic data structure.<p>

C code<p>

The following code reads and parses S-expressions.  It also prints out
the S-expressions in a variety of formats.  (Note that most applications
will not need anything but the simple canonical and transport formats;
the code here is considerably more complex because it also supports the
advanced format, both for input and for output.)  The "sexp-main" program
also contains some documentation on running the program.  (Or just type
"sexp -h" to get the help print-out.)

The code is available under the "MIT License" (open source).

Here are some sample inputs and outputs (warning: while these look like
SDSI/SPKI files, they are only approximations).
