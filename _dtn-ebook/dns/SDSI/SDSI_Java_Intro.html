<title>SDSI 2.0 -- Java Implementation</title>
<body>
<h1>Java Implementation of SPKI/SDSI 2.0</h1>
Three java packages have been built which provide a library of classes that implement the SDSI infrastructure.  These packages are the sdsi.sexp package which implements S-expressions, the sdsi package which implements SDSI objects and the sdsi.control package which provides a GUI with which to use the SDSI system.
<p>
More documentation and explanation for this implentation is on its way.
